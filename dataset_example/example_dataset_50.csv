And desperately, I always wanted to be a member of the bigger rival > gang. One day when I was in my best Easter suit, someone from one of the > other gangs said to me 'would you like to be King of the Golden Apples?' > 'All right, just sit there on this box and call out Apples, Apples, give me > the Golden Apples.' Which innocently I did and they cobbled me with every > rotten apple in the market.Craig Bellamy, Gordon Chisholm & Hilary Ericksen > (2006) Moomba – A festival for the people ==Personal life== Marks married actress Paddie O'Neil in 1952.

"The Imperial Castle in Poznań, popularly called Zamek, ""the Castle"" (, ), is a palace in Poznań, Poland. It was built under German rule in 1910 by Franz Schwechten for William II, German Emperor, with substantial suggestions from the Emperor. Since its completion, the building has housed government offices of Germany (to 1918, and during World War II) and of Poland (1918–1939, 1945–present). ==Naming== The name of this structure is misleading, as the building is a palace rather than a castle. Another difference arises from the adjective imperial (cesarski) preferred by the Poles and royal (königliches) used by the Germans. The German name refers to William II as King of Prussia, in this function he built the palace as his provincial residence, while the Polish name refers to him as Emperor of Germany because the term ""royal"" is reserved for Poznań's Royal Castle, home to the early medieval Kings of Poland. ==Location== The location of the castle was not accidental. After the deconstruction of the polygonal part of the Stronghold Poznań, Poznań was transformed to a residential city (Haupt- und Residenzstadt). On the new lands, Prussian authorities – who annexed the city in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 – decided to build a new Germanic urban core, known as the ""Imperial District"". The projects for the new district were prepared by Josef Stübben. Monumental buildings of the Imperial Districts surrounding the castle included: *Post Office building *headquarters of the Prussian Settlement Commission (now Collegium Maius) *Royal Academy (Königliche Akademie in Posen) (today Aula of the Adam Mickiewicz University, Collegium Minus and the Collegium Iuridicum) *City Theatre (today the opera house) *Academy of Music (Akademia Muzyczna w Poznaniu) *Evangelical-Augsburg Church of St. Paul (today Roman Catholic Church of the Holiest Savior) *Monument to Otto von Bismarck ==Architecture== The castle was built in Neo-Romanesque style, considered by William to be the most ""Germanic"" and representing the glory of the Holy Roman Empire. The new residence was intended to reflect the control over Greater Poland by the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Empire The main building located in the southern part of the complex has two wings: the western – the larger one – consisting of apartments, and the eastern with representative rooms. On the ground floor of the western wing were rooms of the Court Marshal, Chamberlain and other members of imperial court. On the first floor were the apartments of the Emperor and his wife. A private chapel in a Byzantine style (project of August Oetken) was located in a tower. Under the chapel, on the western side of the tower was the entrance reserved for the emperor. From the entrance, stairs lead straight to the first floor. The bedrooms of the emperor and the empress were connected by a corridor with four statues of the following rulers: Margrave Gero, Emperor Otto I, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and Duke Władysław II the Exile. The second floor was planned to be used by the crown prince (the so-called prince rooms). Most of rooms were connected by a foyer surrounding the inner yard. The most impressive room of the representative wing was the Throne Room in Byzantine style. The room was lighted by huge windows from three sides, positioned between the columns and the arches. Eight statues of Holy Roman Emperors were placed under the arches. The throne, designed in an oriental style, was situated under the middle arch. Over the windows was a gallery for guests and the orchestra. The entrance to this part of the castle was from Wałowa Street (today Kościuszki Street). The north part of the complex, facing Berlin Street (now Fredry Street), comprised service rooms, a garage, a stable, and a coach house. These structures and two wings of the main building surround a rose garden that includes a fountain modeled on the Fountain of the Lions in the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra, in Granada, Spain.

The total cost of the building was five million German marks, and the castle is the youngest in Europe.Document :: Facts and figures :: Multimedia City Guide William's first, and only, burgrave (Schlosshauptmann) in 1906–1918 was Polish nobleman, Count Bogdan Hutten- Czapski. After the Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919) and the restoration of independent Poland, the castle became the property of the Second Polish Republic. According to a decision of the Polish government in 1921, the castle became the residence of the Chief of State and later the President of Poland. The building was also used by the Ministry of Former Prussian Partition (Ministerstwo byłej Dzielnicy Pruskiej). Some rooms were also used by the University of Poznań, Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego, and other organizations. After the invasion of Poland and annexation of Greater Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939 at the start of World War II, the German occupiers decided to transform the castle into Adolf Hitler's residence. It was also used by the administrator of the Wartheland, Arthur Greiser. According to this decision, Albert Speer prepared the project of the reconstruction, which completely changed the rooms of the castle. Most of the rooms were changed into the style of the Third Reich. The chapel was changed into the private cabinet of Hitler, with a characteristic balcony with an electric-heated floor. The cabinet was a copy of Hitler's room in the Reich Chancellery; the architectonic details of this room survived World War II and are often used in films. The Throne Room was also transformed into an audience hall. Under the castle, a bunker for 375 people was constructed. The rebuilding was stopped in 1943 due to the Germans' negativity from setbacks on the Eastern Front. During fighting in 1945, the castle was a temporary camp for German POWs, and was later used as a barracks by the Polish People's Army. During this period, the communist government considered the demolition of the castle as a symbol of the German occupation and bourgeois style. Due to a lack of funds, only some of the German symbols were removed and the upper part of the damaged tower was demolished. During the war, the city hall and the seat of the town authorities were destroyed. The castle was renamed ""New City Hall"" (Nowy Ratusz) and later transformed into a center of culture. On 6 June 1979, the castle was declared a historical monument under the protection of the law. Today, the Throne Room is used as a cinema room; other apartments contain art galleries, a puppet theater, pubs, music clubs, and restaurants. A courtyard is often a place of concerts and outdoor movie performances during summer. The second floor is still empty and has not been renovated. The castle is the seat of the honorary consulates of the Philippines, Guatemala, and Slovakia. The square in front of the building is the main venue for the St. Martin's Day parade and celebrations held in Poznań annually on 11 November (see Święty Marcin). ==See also== *Castles in Poland * Royal Castle, Poznań ==References== *Centre of Culture ""Zamek *Jerzy Topolski, Lech Trzeciakowski (red) Dzieje Poznania, tom II cz. 1 1793-1918, Warszawa-Poznań 1994, Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe *Jerzy Topolski, Lech Trzeciakowski (red) Dzieje Poznania, tom II cz. 2 1918-1945, Warszawa-Poznań 1998, Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe *Franciszek Jaśkowiak, Włodzimierz Łęcki, Poznań i okolice.

"Zu is an Italian instrumental band from Rome. While their line-up of baritone sax, bass guitar and drums is typical of a jazz band, their hard-driving sound is indebted to punk rock and according to AllMusic ""defies easy categorization"". Zu have collaborated with a wide variety of musicians and been described as ""masters at adapting to their guests' musical backgrounds"". ==History== Hailing from Ostia (a town near Rome), Zu are an atypical trio consisting of drums, bass, baritone saxophone and electronics. Formed in Rome in 1997, they began as composers and performers for theater productions. The band is composed of three members: Luca Mai on baritone saxophone, Massimo Pupillo on bass and Jacopo Battaglia on drums. Zu have released fourteen albums, including two live albums and two splits. They have played at festivals in Europe, America, Asia and Africa. In 2006, the band toured with the super group Fantômas Melvins Big Band. The members are also active in the Italian folk-jazz group Ardecore. == Style == Zu's music is instrumental and features virtuosic drumming, powerful bass and distorted saxophone. Many of the band's albums are billed as collaborations with a guest musician (such as Mike Patton, Buzz Osborne, Mats Gustafsson and Nobukazu Takemura). Often, a collaborator will join them at live performances as well.

"""My Sister and I"" is a 1941 song written by Hy Zaret, Joan Whitney and Alex Kramer, recorded by Jimmy Dorsey, with vocals by Bob Eberly. ==Background== The Jimmy Dorsey release on Decca Records hit number one on the Billboard charts on June 7, 1941. Sheet music of the time shows a boy and girl in Dutch clothing, with windmills in the background.Sheet music from Broadcast Music, Inc. (New York, 1941). Under the title appears the description ""As inspired by the Current Best Seller 'My Sister and I' by Dirk van der Heide.""The reference is to Dirk van der Heide (trans. Mrs. Antoon Deventer), ""My Sister and I: The Diary of a Dutch Boy Refugee"" (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1941). The lyric is in the voice of a child who has—with a sister—left a war zone by boat and begun a new life abroad. The line ""the fear/That came from a troubled sky"" along with the song's release date implies the evacuation of children from the countries ravaged by World War II, such as the London Blitz the previous winter. ==Other recordings== Other chart hits in 1941 were by Bea Wain, Bob Chester (vocal by Bill Darnell) and by Benny Goodman (vocal by Helen Forrest). ==References== ==Sources== *Stockdale, Robert L.

"Liming is a process used for parchment or leather processing, in which hides are soaked in an alkali solution. It is performed using a drum and paddle or a pit. Its objectives are: * Removal of interfibrillary proteins. * Removal of Keratin proteins. * Collagen swelling due to the alkaline pH. * Collagen fibre bundle splitting. * Removal of natural grease and fatsS.S. Dutta, An Introduction to the Principles of Leather Manufacture, p. 160 Liming operations of cattle hides usually last 18 hours and are generally associated with the alkaline phase of beamhouse operations. ==Removal of interfibrillary proteins== The interfibrillary proteins are denatured by the presence of alkali (particularly sodium sulfide), rendered soluble, facilitating their removal from the leather. Removal is done by the mechanical action of liming or reliming, but more prominently when the pelt is deswelled (during deliming). Failure to remove these proteins results in a hard, tinny leather (due to fibre glueing upon drying) that is brittle and inflexible. ==Keratin removal== Keratin that is present in the hair, scales and in the epidermis of the skin is hydrolyzed in the presence of alkali (at pH values greater than 11.5). The disulfide bridges found in keratin protein are cleaved but can be reformed. Long periods of liming will result in hair removal. The main removal of keratin is performed during the unhairing operation. In traditional processing, liming and unhairing were indivisible and took place at the same time. During modern liming methods, and in particular the processing of sheepskins, the hair is removed first and then limed in a liming drum. In hair-save technology, the hides are unhaired first and then limed for a further 12–18 hours. ==Alkaline collagen swelling== The presence of calcium hydroxide results in the alkaline swelling of skin. The result is an influx of water into the hide/skin, and a marked increase in fibre diameter and fibre shortening. The thickness of the skin increases, but the surface area of the pelt decreases. The weight increase, owing to the uptake of water, results in a doubling of the hide/skin weight. However, this weight also needs to take into consideration that proteins (especially the hair) have been removed, and the fleshing operation is often performed after liming. ==Collagen fibre bundle splitting== The action of liming, in particular the swelling of the skin, results in the splitting of the fibre bundle sheath. Owing to the fibre diameter increasing, the bundle sheath cannot contain the thicker fibres, and it bursts open. This allows increased access to the fibres, which allows better tanning, retanning, dyeing and fatliquoring. ==References== Category:Leathermaking","['Keratin', 'Collagen']","['Q189474', 'Q26868']","[[[233, 240], [1046, 1053], [1064, 1071]], [[253, 261], [297, 305], [2328, 2336]]]"

During the 17th century, two distinct villages were formed in the area around Hakunila; Håkansböle and Nissbacka. The name of the village, Håkansböle, derives from the name of the original founder of the village, Håkan Jönsson, who lived in the area in the 16th century. ==Amenities== At the center of the town, there is a small shopping centre containing a supermarket and a pharmacy, among other amenities such as restaurants and bars. Next to the center is a library and a school, which form a single building. In the surrounding area there is also another school, stables, and a swimming hall. The swimming hall regularly closes in the summer and duties are transferred to the larger swimming hall in nearby Tikkurila. Most of the buildings in the area are tower blocks and flats, with some terraced and semi detached houses being found in the outskirts of the town. There are also numerous cross- country skiing trails in use during the winter. ==Transport== Hakunila is connected to the rest of Vantaa and the metropolitan area of Helsinki by the HSL bus network, with the nearest commuter rail stop being in Tikkurila, and the nearest metro station being in Mellunmäki.

"Édouard de Reszke (22 December 185325 May 1917) was a Polish bass from Warsaw. A member of the musical Reszke family, he was a successful opera singer, as were his brother Jean and his sister Josephine. He made his debut in Aida in Paris on 22 April 1876. Born with an impressive natural voice and equipped with compelling histrionic skills, he became one of the most illustrious opera singers active in Europe and America during the late-Victorian era. He is most famous for his role as Mephistopheles in Faust. He was also known for his roles as Leporello, Sachs, and Hagen. When in London, the Reszke brothers performed for Queen Victoria during gala performances at the Royal Opera House or command performances at Windsor Castle. He was awarded the Royal Victorian Order (R.V.O.) from the Queen. The Reszke brothers were entertained near London by Lady de Grey, a patron of the arts. After he retired from the stage, he taught singing until he had significant health problems. He and his family suffered during the war, cut off from others, with shooting through opposite sides of the house. His health worsened during the war and he died in 1917. ==Early life== Édouard August Reszke was born to Jan Reszke and Emilja (also Emilie) Ufniarska on 22 December 1853. His parents operated the Hôtel de Saxe (de) in the center of Warsaw, which catered to artists from Moscow, Berlin, and Paris. It adjoined their residence. His mother, a mezzo-soprano, had a clear, powerful voice. His father, a baritone, played the violin and wrote songs for his wife. The Reszkes held concerts on Friday nights with duets, arias and choral music. Both of his parents performed at charity events. His siblings were Emilia, Jean (born 1850), Josephine (1855), and Victor (1859). Emilja taught her children to sing; all of whom were talented singers. At times the four oldest children, called the Reszke Quartet, performed together. Viktor was not interested in music. Josephine, Jean, and Édouard sang at a soirée in 1869. Reszke attended an agricultural college in Germany for two years. When he returned to Warsaw, Jean noticed that his brother's voice had deepened significantly. Wanting to understand how his singing voice changed, Jean played the piano while Reszke sang, after which he told his parents that with his brother's talent, he should change his career goals and pursue an opera career. He followed his desired to sing over his parents' plan for a career in agriculture. He went to Italy and studied under Francesco Steller and later the retired baritone Filippo Coletti, who was also a friend. He studied with Giovanni Sbriglia in Paris. By 1875, his sister Josephine was a prima donna at the Paris Opera; Reszke and his mother travelled with her. He sang at musicals as an amateur. Beginning in 1876, the Reszke brothers became known amongst Paris society and composers for their singing talent. == Career == === Stage === Reszke debuted in Aida in Paris on 22 April 1876. He was chosen by the composer Giuseppe Verdi for the role of the King of Egypt. Fortunately, he knew the opera well, being hired just days before the performance. He was asked to grow a beard so that he looked more like a king than the young man that he was. That year, Reszke began using the French version of his surname: de Reszke. Josephine and Jean, who had careers as opera singers, changed their surname that year, too. After Aida, he performed at the Théâtre des Italiens for two seasons. In 1879, he performed in Maria Tudor at the Teatro alla Scala and Indra in the premiere of Le roi de Lahore in Milan. The role of Ilda was created for him by Jules Massenet. He sang at Covent Garden in London in 1880. The following year, he performed in The Prodigal Son, Simon Boccanegra, and Ernani. He performed as Charles V in Don Giovanni d'Austria and the king in Elda in cities including Lisbon, Trieste, and Turin. He performed in Italian opera at London's Covent Garden. While there, the Reszkes were often entertained at the residence of Lady de Grey, who treated the men like royalty and enjoyed their senses of humor. One night when they missed their train for London to perform at Covent Garden, a guest remembered he was the honorary president of the local fire brigade and arranged for them to be taken to London at good speed. Reszke admired his brother, who was the leader of the two. He gladly sacrificed opportunities for a better and more independent career to perform with him once Jean had established himself as a tenor. In 1884, they appeared in Hérodiade at the Théâtre-Italien. Later in the run, Josephine joined her brothers in the role of Salome. In Le Cid, Jean had the title role and Edouard created the role of Don Diègue. They also performed in Roméo et Juliette and Don Giovanni. Reszke and his brother Jean and sister Josephine were described as a jolly trio: In 1887, they performed in Gounod's Faust at the Paris Opéra. Reszke was best known for his role as Mephistopheles, overshadowing his brother. He was compared to Faure, a tenor who had earlier performed as the legendary demon. He excelled as Mephistopheles due to his genuine bass voice and his imposing physical presence. It was in that year he acquired the reputation of a great singer. The brothers were at Covent Garden from 1887 to 1890. They performed in French productions of a full-length version of Faust as well as Les Huguenots with Jean Lassalle and under the impresario Augustus Harris. To these, operas, they added Wagner operas to their repertoire, beginning with Lohengrin and Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg , sung in Italian. The Reszkes then performed in Warsaw and Russia. As Poles, the Reszkes were Russian citizens. During the winter of 1889–1890, they were called to a command performance by the Tsar of Russia, which made Jean nervous. The performance, and other command performances, went well for the Tsar, who ennobled the Reszkes in appreciation. More than three decades earlier, their father Jan Reszke had been exiled to Siberia in 1863 by the Russian government for his leadership role in the January Uprising; he was there five years. They frequently performed together in the United States, beginning in Chicago then, in 1891. at New York's Metropolitan Opera. They starred with Nellie Melba in Elaine by Bemberg. Maurice Grau of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau had a formula for winning casts: the Reszke brothers, Lassalle, Plancon, and two prima donnas. According to The New York Times, that period was considered the ""golden days"" of art and great voices. He and his brother were among the list of well-known opera singers from Poland. Reszke performed a wide range of roles in French, German and Italian operas, including works by Wagner, Verdi, Gounod, and Meyerbeer. In addition to his role as Mephistopheles, he was known for the roles of Leporello, Sachs, and Hagen. A tall, genial man, Reszke possessed a big, smooth, flexible and ripe-toned voice that matched his imposing physique and extroverted personality. He had a ""full, resonant bass, capable of sending forth notes of immense volume or those of the most tender quality. His appearance was that of a broad-shouldered giant, with fair skin and blue eyes, and his stage presence was imposing. In 1903, he retired from the stage and helped his brother teach singing in Paris, and four years later opened a singing school in London. In 1909, he closed his school in London due to recurring bouts of bronchitis and dizziness and began to teach in Warsaw until forced into retirement by health problems. ===Queen Victoria=== In the 25 years since Prince Albert's death, Queen Victoria did little entertaining, but in 1889 she issued a command for Emma Albani and the Reszke brothers to join her at Windsor Castle. The three performed solos and duets from L'Étoile du Nord, Lohengrin, Faust, Sweet Bird, Carmen, and La traviata. The Queen expressed her appreciation while ""smiling and full of kindness"". The same year, they performed a gala performance for the Shah of Persia. In 1890, after a performance of Faust at Windsor Castle, Reszke was given the Royal Victorian Order by the Queen, as was his brother fourteen months earlier. The Queen wrote of the Reszkes in her diary: === Recordings === Reszke made three records for commercial release that were recorded by the Columbia Phonograph Company in 1903. Mapleson Cylinders, primitive recordings made privately during an actual performance at the Metropolitan Opera in 1901, exist. It has been released with other performances on CD by the Symposium label. == Personal life == Reszke married Helene Schütze in 1885. Her brother Willie was secretary to the Reszke brothers. Her sister Félia Litvinne, born Françoise- Jeanne Schütz, sang with the men. With Helene, they had four daughters, one of whom was Minia (Emilie). She was close with both her father and her uncle Jean. When her father was to return home, she waited for him with his favorite dog. Minia considered her father to be the ""most good"" man she had known and was considered so by many others. Emma Eames said, ""He was like a great big St. Bernard. You always wanted to pat him."" Reszke's best friend in the United States was Laura Tolman (Tolmanina), a cellist. He spent evenings with her, listening to her play her cello, beginning in the early 1890s. They saw each other until he retired from the stage and left the country. He had intended to return for a visit with her, but he never did. They continued to correspond. Among the gifts that he gave her was a St. Bernard to protect her. While they were single, the brothers spent the summers at Borowno, near Klomnice, where they owned an ancient castle or chateau of French and Russian architecture. It had been unchanged since it was rebuilt in 1791. It had a kitchen garden of several acres, was amongst thousands of acres of forest, and was the site of their first stud-farm. The stud farm and racing stable at Borowno employed about 400 local people, which was most of the residents of the village. Reszke built a house near Garnek, Poland about 1895. It was his main residence in Poland and he owned a property named Klobukowice, which had one simple house. Jean had a manor house in Skrzydlów. It was six miles from Borowno, where he lived most of the time. He also had property at Zdrowa and Chorzenice. The Warta winds its way through the brothers' estates. Ponds and lakes on the estate were stocked with fish, including perch, trout, and carp. Deer, wild boars, turkey, and wolves lived in their forests. They farmed and raised cattle. ===World War I=== At the start of World War I (1914), residents of Warsaw had been told to flee the city for their safety. Children were told to cross the Alexandrian Bridge (pl), and that they would return later. As children marched across the bridge, Reszke sang Jescze Polska nie zginęła (pl) (English: Poland Is Not Yet Lost). He retired to his estate in Poland, where he was adversely affected by the outbreak of World War I in Europe in 1914. He, his wife, and his daughters were stuck at their estate in Granek, cut off from his brother in Paris by the fighting. He had a difficult time earning money for his family and they lived in destitution during the war. At the start of the war, lines of communication were closed to them. His 12,000-acre estate called Borowno was in ruins and they lived in the cellar for one year. Princess and Prince Lubomirski, their neighbors, lived underground with them. They had little food and were generally unsuccessful foraging for food. The Russian and German troops were on opposite sides of their house and during their conflict they shot through the house. Having run out of coal and with just a handful grain, they were cold and hungry. After the troops left the area, they were somewhat comfortable for a time, but then had to hide out in a cold cave for their protection. After that they returned home. Reszke became ill and suffered from crippling rheumatism. He became very thin and unable to lie down, so he spent his time in an arm chair for a while. He was cared for by his wife and children, during which time he told funny and interesting stories about his career to lighten the mood. Reszke died of illness on 25 May 1917 in Garnek, near Częstochowa, Poland ( from the village of Borowno.) or at his estate in Erietrikov, Poland. He was buried at the Michalski family tomb at the Borowno estate. Daughter Minia comforted Jean after her father's death, and was with Jean when he died. == Appearances == === Royal Opera House, Covent Garden === His appearances at the Royal Opera House at Covent

"""Flaws and All"" is a song by American recording artist Beyoncé, included on the 2007 deluxe edition of her second studio album, B'Day (2006). It was composed by Ne-Yo, Shea Taylor, Beyoncé and Solange Knowles, while Beyoncé Knowles and Taylor produced it. In the R&B; song, Beyoncé shows appreciation for the love given by her man, who sees through all of her flaws and loves her unconditionally. ""Flaws and All"" received positive reviews from critics, who lauded Beyoncé's emotion and vulnerability on the track. Some critics also noted that the song was better than some of the songs on the standard edition of B'Day. The music video was directed by Cliff Watts and Beyoncé for B'Day Anthology Video Album (2007). It features clips of a B'Day promotional ad by Wal-Mart pieced together, in which Beyoncé does not lip-sync the words of the song, but instead acts as if it were an everyday scenario. Beyoncé explained the concept for the video was to show a different side to her, that the paparazzi does not show and that fans would not normally see. Beyoncé performed ""Flaws and All"" on The Beyoncé Experience (2007), and was also sung by her on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live (2012), and Renaissance World Tour (2023). ==Background == ""Flaws and All"" was written by Ne-Yo, Shea Taylor, Beyoncé Knowles and her sister Solange Knowles. The R&B; song was produced by Beyoncé Knowles and Taylor, and mixed by Jean-Marie Horvat at Oz Recording Studios, Valencia, California. ""Flaws and All"" was recorded by Jim Caruana, Shane Woodley and Robert ""LB"" Dorsey at Roc the Mic studio, New York City. Although the song was originally included on the re- release of B'Day, it was additionally included on compilation albums. In 2007 the song was included on Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married? soundtrack. In 2008, Beyoncé released the song on a compilation album dedicated to karaoke performances titled Beyoncé Karaoke Hits, Vol. I. Author Latrice Gleen references the song in a memoir titled My Life's Journey (2010). ==Reception== Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly named the song as his favorite addition to the deluxe edition of B'Day, stating, ""Better is 'Flaws and All', a ballad in which B[eyoncé] expresses melismatic gratitude that workaholic bitches (her words!) merit love too."" Rory Dollard of Metro also wrote that the song was better than some of the tracks on the original track listing of B'Day. While reviewing the deluxe edition of B'Day, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the song, calling it a ""surprise gem [which] sound[s] downright subtle"". BET included the song in its list of the ""Top 10 Feel Good R&B; Songs"", ranked at number nine. Discussing their choice, they stated ""'Flaws and All' ... revealed Beyoncé at her most vulnerable. The song showed that even a superstar can struggle with insecurities and be in need of someone to love her."" Bobby Reed of Chicago Sun-Times noted that the lyrics could also refer to ""the way fans worship Beyonce"". Anthony Venutolo of New Jersey On- Line noted that the song talks about true love. Destiny's Child bandmate Kelly Rowland discussed the track during Billboard ""Woman of the Year"" spread for Beyoncé. She stated ""Beyoncé is a true artist who brings it every time. My favorite song will always be 'Flaws and All.' So much feeling, so beautiful; her voice sounds amazing."" ==Music video== Well, I am a little silly, I am a little goofy, and it's great. There are a lot of things I keep to myself, because that's the only way you keep your sanity. This [video] is the way my family sees me, it's me being who I really am. It's been 10 years, and it's time for people to see that side of me. It's not about glamour, not about celebrity, not about being a diva — it's about someone loving you for you. —Beyoncé Beyoncé, Beyoncé: Behind the B'Day Music Videos The music video for ""Flaws and All"" was directed by Cliff Watts and Beyoncé. The video for the song was shot on inexpensive Super 8 film during the two- week filming for the B'Day Anthology Video Album (2007). Critics have noted that Beyoncé emulates Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot and Barbra Streisand throughout the clip. During an interview with MTV on a ""Beyoncé: Behind the B'Day Music Videos"", MTV commented on Beyoncé's appearance in the music video stating that she acts like ""a goofball"" and ""it also feels like we get to see the real [her]."" Beyoncé replied, ""I'm way different in my everyday life. My personal life and my celebrity life — I've separated them so much it's like two different people. But I'm pretty balanced. I'm over the top and I'm natural."" In an interview with Vibe, Beyoncé explained that the concept for the video in depth after being questioned as an ""everyday woman."" ""I don't sing any of the song. The whole time it's like a silent movie and I'm being myself. I'm not performing. I reveal a side of myself no one's ever seen. I'm silly and goofy and not...trying to be a diva, or trying to be a star – just me."" The video features a black and white theme and a grainy film texture. Beyoncé does not lip-sync the lyrics but acts out parts of the song and poses. Several of the scenes used in the video had been shot in 2006 for a B'Day promotional ad by Wal-Mart. ==Live performances== Beyoncé performed the song on multiple occasions, including the song as part of her set list on The Beyoncé Experience (2007). Beyoncé cried during the performance, and was then embraced by a male dancer dressed as an angel. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly praised Beyoncé's performance of the song stating ""The true defibrillator moment, all freakum dress changes aside, is 'Flaws and All', during which Beyoncé weeps real tears (nightly, according to reports from earlier overseas shows) while apologizing for being such a bitch. That's a rare campy, melodramatic performance in an otherwise energized two hours."" The performance also caught the attention of The New York Times writer Jon Pareles who stated, ""Along the way the concert was a showcase for her consistently expanding music, from the kinetic dance beats of songs like 'Get Me Bodied' to dramatic ballads like 'Flaws and All', which Beyoncé sang wide-eyed in a video close-up."" J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post wrote that during the performance she was offering a ""litany of her own 'imperfections' that her lover embraces unconditionally"". Anthony Venutolo of New Jersey On-Line wrote that the performance was ""silly"". The performance of the song in Los Angeles on September 2, 2007, was taped and included on The Beyoncé Experience Live. The performance of the song was also shown independently at MTV.com and was released via digital download at the iTunes Store on November 19, 2007. Beyoncé performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 25, 2008 while promoting her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce. In May, 2012, she performed ""Flaws and All"" as a part of her revue show Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live at Revel Atlantic City. While reviewing the show, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote, ""She has a fast-reacting face, and opens her eyes wide to look astonished, touched, or grateful. (She did this especially during 'Flaws and All,' which she dedicated to her fans: 'I don't know why you love me/And that's why I love you.')"" A writer for Vibe magazine listed the performance of the song in the five notable moments from the concerts, saying that Beyoncé ""had the camera zoom in on her face the whole time, showing the crowd her own 'flaws,' allowing the crowd to connect to her"". ""Flaws and All"" was also included on the live album Live in Atlantic City (2013) which was filmed during the revue. In 2013, Beyoncé added the song to the set list of her worldwide The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. During the performance she dedicated the song to her fans, the BeyHive. A decade later, the song again appears on the setlist of Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, as part of the show's first act composed mainly of ballads and deep cuts from the artist's discography. ==Credits and personnel== Credits are taken from B'Day Deluxe Edition liner notes. *Jim Caruana – recording *Tom Coyne – mastering *Rober ""LB"" Dorsey – recording *Jean-Marie Horvat – mixing *Beyoncé Knowles – writing, production, vocals *Solange Knowles – writing *Collin Miller – digital prep engineering *Ne-Yo – writing, co-production *Shea Taylor – writing, production *Michael Tocci – recording *Shane Woodley – recording ==References== ==External links== *Beyoncé's official website Category:2000s ballads Category:2007 songs Category:Beyoncé songs Category:Contemporary R&B; ballads Category:Songs written by Beyoncé Category:Songs written by Solange Knowles Category:Songs written by Ne-Yo Category:Songs written by Shea Taylor Category:Song recordings produced by Beyoncé Category:Song recordings produced by Shea Taylor","['Beyoncé Knowles', ""B'Day"", 'New York City', 'Ne-Yo', 'Shea Taylor', 'Solange Knowles', ""B'Day Anthology Video Album"", 'Wal-Mart', 'The Beyoncé Experience', 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show', 'Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live', 'Valencia, California', 'Tyler Perry', 'Entertainment Weekly', 'Slant Magazine', 'Chicago Sun-Times', 'New Jersey On-Line', ""Destiny's Child"", 'Kelly Rowland', 'Marilyn Monroe', 'Brigitte Bardot', 'Barbra Streisand', 'MTV', 'The New York Times', 'The Washington Post', 'The Beyoncé Experience Live', 'I Am...

"The Code of Leovigild or Codex Revisus was a Visigothic legal code, a revision of the Codex Euricianus made in the late sixth century under Leovigild (568-586). The code does not survive and all we know of it is derived from the writings of Isidore of Seville, a near contemporary ecclesiastic and encyclopaedist. Nevertheless, it was the Gothic basis of the later Liber Iudiciorum, an Hispanian law code which united it with the law code of the Hispano-Roman population, the Breviary of Alaric. In 1974, García Gallo made a critical examination of the evidence for the code and came to reject the claim of Isidore that Leovigild had formulated a new code, since the laws of Chindasuinth dictated modifications to laws more ancient the reign of Leovigild.

"Spy Hunter II is an arcade game released by Bally Midway in 1987 as sequel to 1983's Spy Hunter. Unlike its popular predecessor, Spy Hunter II was not ported to any contemporary systems and remained obscure. George Gomez, who designed the original, was critical of the sequel made by the studio without his involvement. ==Gameplay== The gameplay is similar to the original Spy Hunter but takes place in a 3D overhead behind the car view. The player can obtain several weapons just like in the original Spy hunter such as oil slicks, missiles and smoke screen. The game also includes a two player co- operative mode where the players can help each other out. The arcade cabinet uses a single monitor divided by a bezel and two steering wheels. Both the cabinet and in-game design were previously seen in Bally Midway's Max RPM, released the year before. ==Legacy== Spy Hunter II was included on the collection Midway Arcade Treasures 2. The game was also included in the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. ==References== Category:1987 video games Category:Arcade video games Category:Arcade-only video games Category:Spy Hunter Category:Vehicular combat games Category:Midway video games Category:Video games developed in the United States","['Vehicular combat game', 'Spy Hunter', 'Midway Arcade Treasures 2', 'Midway Arcade Origins', 'PlayStation 3', 'Xbox 360']","['Q2070892', 'Q1788165', 'Q16258859', 'Q16258856', 'Q10683', 'Q48263']","[[[1172, 1193]], [[0, 10], [85, 95], [129, 139], [373, 383], [864, 874], [1152, 1162]], [[909, 934]], [[987, 1008]], [[1013, 1026]], [[1031, 1039]]]"

"Drury v. Her Majesty's Advocate is a Scottish criminal case heard before a full bench (five judges) of the High Court of Justiciary sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal. Stuart Drury had been convicted of killing his former partner with a hammer on concluding that she had begun a new relationship with another man. The original trial judge directed the jury that a finding of culpable homicide could only be made where the accused had not intended to kill and had not displayed enough wicked recklessness to convict of murder, and that a defence of provocation was only possible if the violence was proportionate to the provocation itself. In the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgement, the Lord Justice General, Lord Rodger, sought to clarify what he considered to be an incomplete standard definition of murder: This was a controversial opinion, as it made murder a more difficult charge to prove. Normally, when prosecuting, the Crown seeks to establish the appropriate actus reus, mens rea, and lack of any defences; however, Drury suggests that the mens rea of murder is ""wicked recklessness"", where wicked means there is no defence. This means that, if a defence exists, there is no mens rea. The effect of this is that, if the accused successfully pleads provocation or diminished responsibility, his conviction is reduced from murder to culpable homicide. This conflicts with the principle that a defence may be based on a mistaken belief by the accused (e.g. the belief he was being attacked), but that the belief must be reasonable (Owens v HMA). Drury cannot be reconciled with this idea because holding an unreasonable belief may be ""reckless"" but it is not ""wicked"". ==References== * Drury v HMA is reported at 2001 S.C.C.R. 583.

"An allocation questionnaire is a form used in English legal practice. After a claim is made, if a defence is filed each party is required to complete and return an allocation questionnaire to the court so that the judge may properly allocate the claim to a track and give further directions towards a final hearing. ==Forms on the Internet== Sample allocation questionnaires are available on the Internet. The official UK Courts web site has many forms available, including the allocation questionnaire. The actual form is available, as of March 2007, as a pdf file. The Citizens Advice Bureau provides a generic legal advice web site with information about the words and phrases used in small claims procedure in UK Courts.AdviceGuide.org.uk from the Citizens Advice Bureau. ==The form itself== The allocation questionnaire is a Pivotal Point in the judicial process requesting the following information: * Whether you wish to have a month to settle the case. * What is the location or venue of the case, and why it is chosen. * Whether any pre- action protocols applied, and whether these were complied with. * What is the amount of the claim in dispute. * Who you will call as lay or expert witnesses. * Whether the case should be considered small claims, or another track. * How long you think the trial will take. * How much your costs will be (in Pounds sterling). ==Tracks== There are three tracks: # Small claims - any claim up to £10,000 and certain personal injury and tenant claims under £1,000. # Fast track - disputes involving between £10,000 and £25,000. # Multi-track - disputes that are claimed to be over £25,000, or in certain cases where the claim is for less than £25,000 but the complexity of the evidence and/or legal issues to be decided means the claim is better suited to the Multi-track, particularly where a claim will take more than 1 day to try.

"Super-Hip is a fictional character that appeared in comic books published by DC Comics. He first appeared in The Adventures of Bob Hope #95 (October–November 1965), in a story written by Arnold Drake and drawn by Bob Oksner. ==Publication history== Super-Hip appeared regularly in The Adventures of Bob Hope from issue #95 until issue #107, where he only appears in the last two panels. He does not appear in what would be the last two issues, #108 and #109, of the series. Super-Hip's sole non-Bob Hope appearance in the Silver Age was in Doom Patrol vol. 1, #104 (June 1966), as one of several super-hero guests (although the only ""humor title"" guest) at the wedding of Elasti-Girl and Mento. The story was scripted by Arnold Drake. In the modern era, Super- Hip makes a brief appearance in Batman: The Brave and the Bold #15 (March 2010), fighting the Mad Mod alongside Batman and Brother Power, The Geek. He appeared in Doom Patrol #20 (March 2011). According to the events of the issue (wherein he grants succor to a recently deported Doom Patrol), he is an old friend of Cliff Steele, a.k.a. Robotman. ==Fictional character biography== Tadwallader Jutefruce (a spooneristic pun on ""fruit juice"") is the crew cut and bow tie-clad 'nephew' of Bob Hope and a student at Benedict Arnold High School, an educational facility whose ""Faculty of Fear"" is made up entirely of Universal Horror-style monsters, including principal Dr. Van Pyre, German- accented science teacher Prof. Heinrich von Wolfmann, and coach Franklin Stein. Whenever Tad loses his temper (usually at the instigation of a stupid prank by fellow students billionaire biker bully Badger Goldliver and his simple-minded stooge Doltish), the uptight mild-mannered boy genius turns green, starts to spin like a tornado and transforms into Super-Hip. The long- haired Super-Hip's outfit resembles a 1960s Carnaby Street Mod a la Austin Powers, complete with ruffled shirt, velvet jacket, and Chelsea boots with winged ankles that, similar to the Sub-Mariner, allow him to fly. He also magically acquires an electric guitar which causes whoever hears it to dance uncontrollably whenever he plays rock and roll, and he can change his form into virtually anything, limited only by his often surreal imagination. Tad has no memory of his time as the obnoxious and egotistical ""Sultan of Swingers"", and the only ones who know of his secret identity are his Uncle Bob and his highly educated talking dog, Harvard-Harvard. Super-Hip's battle-cry is ""Down with/Blech to Lawrence Welk!"", as hearing the television bandleader's schmaltzy music acts like kryptonite on him. ==References== ==External links== * Super-Hip at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

"The Art of Love is the eighth studio album by German singer Sandra released in 2007 by Virgin Records. ==Background== The Art of Love is Sandra's first album not to be produced by her then-partner, Michael Cretu, who at that time was unavailable due to working on the new Enigma album, A Posteriori. It was also her last album released before their separation in late 2007. Instead, the material was produced by Jens Gad, Cretu's ""right hand man"". This change made Sandra actively participate in writing songs for the first time in her career. She contributed very personal lyrics, revisiting sad experiences from her childhood. The album also includes three cover versions: ""Put Your Arms Around Me"" originally recorded by Sinéad O'Connor, ""All You Zombies"" by The Hooters, and ""Casino Royale"", previously recorded by Edyta Górniak as ""Sleep with Me"" and Conjure One as ""Sleep"". ""Love Is the Price"" features DJ BoBo and is their second collaboration, after the 2006 hit ""Secrets of Love"". The promotional pictures for the album, shot in New York by Bärbel Miebach, saw Sandra return to her signature long hair and reveal a sexier image. ""The Way I Am"" was released as the lead single from the album in January 2007 and reached no. 50 on the official German singles chart. ""What Is It About Me"" was released as the second single in May 2007 and failed to chart except for some airplay in russian Tophit charts reaching position 129.The single had three bonus tracks: the album track ""What D'Ya Think of Me"", French version of ""What's Left to Say"" (""Les qu'est-ce que c'est"") and Spanish version of ""Silence Beside Me"" (""Silencio a mi lado"").

Before the voting of the parliament, he warned that the Egyptian Army was not prepared, opining that there would be little real fighting. The battle plan was unclear and war aims were vague, making al-Mwawi uncertain of his objectives. On May 15 he led the Egyptian Expeditionary Forces into Palestine. The Egyptians numbered between 7,000 and 10,000 troops, divided into two brigades. The Egyptian Expeditionary Forces comprised the 1st Infantry Battalion (numbering 700-750), the 6th Infantry Battalion (700-750), the 9th Infantry Battalion (700-750), an armoured reconnaissance battalion (35 armoured vehicles), a light tank battalion (seven tanks), three 25 pound cannon batteries (24 cannons), one 18 pound cannon battery (eight cannons) and one six pound anti-tank cannon battery (eight cannons).

It lies in the Blatná Uplands. The highest point is a hill with an altitude of . The territory is rich in ponds, the largest of them is Široký. ==History== The first written mention of Oselce is from 1388. The Knights of Oselce owned the village from 1388 until the 16th century. A fortress in Oselce was first documented in the mid-16th century, but it was probably older. From 1673 to 1805, Oselce was property of the Janovský of Janovice family. The next notable owners of Oselce was the Booss-Waldeck family, who held the castle from 1832 to 1945.

"The Indian Grand Prix was a Formula One race in the calendar of the FIA Formula One World Championship, which was held at the Buddh International Circuit in sector 25 along Yamuna Expressway in Gautam Buddh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh from 2011 until 2013. The first edition took place on 30 October 2011, as the 17th race of the 2011 Formula One season. The inaugural race was won by Germany's Sebastian Vettel. Jaypee Sports International Limited is the organizer of Formula One racing in India and has signed a five-year contract with Formula One Management (FOM) to host the championship in India. In August 2013, FIA announced that the Indian Grand Prix would miss the 2014 edition before returning to an early-season slot in 2015. Subsequently, due to a tax dispute with the Uttar Pradesh government, the 2015 edition was cancelled and its possible return delayed until 2016. However, no resolution was found and the grand prix has never been restored to the calendar. == History == As early as 1997, there were plans to host an Indian Grand Prix at Calcutta. In 2003, India had only two permanent raceways, one in Chennai (Irungattukottai), and the Kari Motor Speedway in Coimbatore. At that time two sites in the vicinity of the Bangalore airport were examined. Also, in the state of Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu reserved of land near the airport at Hyderabad. Vicky Chandhok, father of Karun Chandhok, stated in an interview: ""Andhra Pradesh is really pushing it like no other state! It is great to see a Chief Minister pushing so hard. Bangalore is a great location, mainly because of the weather"". In December 2003, a seven-year pre-agreement to host the GP in Hyderabad in 2007 was signed. The track was to be built near Gopanapally village, near the outskirts of Hyderabad, and consisted of of land. However, in 2004 competition arose from Mumbai, to change the location from Hyderabad to Mumbai. Formula One commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone expected India to host a Grand Prix within three years, aiming for locating at either Hyderabad or Mumbai. In the end these projects were never realised, possibly owing to anti-tobacco legislation, and a change in government policy. Both projects then were declared ""dead"" in the second half of 2004, when Mumbai's government decided ""not to waste money on car fumes while there are more serious issues"", and the Hyderabad location was converted to an IT park for technology companies. However, sites at Mumbai were still being investigated (Gorai and Navi Mumbai). In 2005, Narain Karthikeyan was due to demonstrate a Jordan Grand Prix car in Mumbai, but the road proved to be too bumpy. In 2007, five locations remained in the running for hosting the Indian Grand Prix: Bangalore; the Gurgaon district in the state of Haryana; a permanent track somewhere near New Delhi; a street circuit in New Delhi, as proposed by Vijay Mallya; and a site in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Following months of negotiations, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and Ecclestone announced in June 2007 a provisional agreement for India to host its first Grand Prix as a part of the 2009 Formula One season. The track would be built in Gurgaon, in consultation with architect Hermann Tilke. However, in September 2007 it was announced that the debut race would take place in 2010 on the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida. After further assessments of the timeframe involved, Ecclestone announced in September 2008 that the Indian Grand Prix had been delayed to 2011. In October 2008, the Renault F1 team showcased their car on a tour across all the sites which were previously linked to a Formula One circuit in India, except Mumbai: Gurgaon, Lucknow, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata. In November 2008 they also performed a street demonstration on Rajpath at the India Gate end, New Delhi; the car was driven by Nelson Piquet Jr. In August 2009, the McLaren team showcased their car in Lucknow. On 11 October 2009, the Red Bull Racing team gave a demonstration in Mumbai. David Coulthard drove the Red Bull car across Mumbai's Bandra–Worli Sea Link. The Indian Grand Prix had the potential to generate around $170 million in revenue and employ as many as 10,000 people. The opportunity in advertising tie-ups between manufacturers and Formula One were also a consideration. The race coincided with the important Diwali holiday, when consumer spending is typically at its highest and many people are traveling, which further improved economic prospects. It was one of the few F1 races at the time that were not subsidized by government, and the venue had to pay $40 million per year to Formula One Holdings to host the event. == Circuit == The race was held at the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida near New Delhi between 2011 and 2013. The 5.125 km circuit has been designed by German architect Hermann Tilke. Four million cubic tons of earth were moved to achieve the rise and fall through the lap. The track is spread across an area of 875 acres, and is a part of Jaypee Green Sports city. == Winners== All Indian Grands Prix were held at Buddh International Circuit.

The circuit, despite the placards saying ""New Delhi"" is not located in the union territory of Delhi, but in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh. The government of Uttar Pradesh, led by the then Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that F1 is not a sport, but entertainment and levied taxes on the event. ==References== ==External links== * F1 Indian Grand Prix * Formula 1 * Exhaustive Coverage of Indian F1 Grand Prix (Pics and Report) Category:Sport in Uttar Pradesh Category:Formula One Grands Prix Category:National Grands Prix Category:2011 establishments in Uttar Pradesh Category:India sport-related lists Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2011 Category:Recurring sporting events disestablished in 2013 Category:2013 disestablishments in India","['Buddh International Circuit', 'Sebastian Vettel', 'Red Bull Racing', 'Formula One', 'Yamuna Expressway', 'Gautam Buddh Nagar', 'Uttar Pradesh', 'Calcutta', 'Chennai', 'Kari Motor Speedway', 'Coimbatore', 'Bangalore', 'Andhra Pradesh', 'Karun Chandhok', 'Mumbai', 'Bernie Ecclestone', 'Narain Karthikeyan', 'Jordan Grand Prix', 'Gurgaon', 'Haryana', 'Vijay Mallya', 'Lucknow', 'Indian Olympic Association', 'Hermann Tilke', 'Greater Noida', 'Rajpath', 'India Gate', 'Nelson Piquet Jr.', 'McLaren', 'David Coulthard', 'Bandra–Worli Sea Link', 'Diwali', 'Formula One Holdings', '2012 Indian Grand Prix', 'Delhi', 'Akhilesh Yadav']","['Q172906', 'Q42311', 'Q173663', 'Q1968', 'Q8048110', 'Q1785950', 'Q1498', 'Q1348', 'Q1352', 'Q6370393', 'Q9885', 'Q1355', 'Q1159', 'Q172905', 'Q1156', 'Q172724', 'Q82936', 'Q171367', 'Q238508', 'Q1174', 'Q173118', 'Q47916', 'Q1371252', 'Q57759', 'Q2711899', 'Q2504164', 'Q245347', 'Q172838', 'Q172030', 'Q172832', 'Q314572', 'Q10244', 'Q174035', 'Q74212', 'Q1353', 'Q417657']","[[[126, 153], [3353, 3380], [4742, 4769], [5130, 5157]], [[399, 415], [5190, 5206], [5238, 5254], [5286, 5302]], [[3997, 4012], [5207, 5222], [5255, 5270], [5303, 5318]], [[28, 39], [72, 83], [339, 350], [473, 484], [542, 553], [1934, 1945], [3154, 3165], [3666, 3677], [4313, 4324], [4663, 4674], [6516, 6527]], [[173, 190]], [[194, 212]], [[225, 238], [785, 798], [2945, 2958], [5805, 5818], [6170, 6183], [6203, 6216], [6493, 6506], [6602, 6615]], [[1060, 1068]], [[1125, 1132]], [[1160, 1179]], [[1183, 1193]], [[1241, 1250], [1570, 1579], [2761, 2770], [3729, 3738]], [[1296, 1310], [1460, 1474]], [[1419, 1433]], [[1877, 1883], [1926, 1932], [2088, 2094], [2295, 2301], [2493, 2499], [2546, 2552], [2633, 2639], [3703, 3709], [4042, 4048], [4096, 4102]], [[1971, 1988], [5521, 5538]], [[2564, 2582]], [[2608, 2625]], [[2776, 2783], [3202, 3209], [3711, 3718]], [[2809, 2816]], [[2908, 2920]], [[2936, 2943], [3720, 3727], [3964, 3971]], [[2998, 3024]], [[3242, 3255], [4884, 4897]], [[3384, 3397], [4773, 4786]], [[3826, 3833]], [[3841, 3851]], [[3890, 3907]], [[3928, 3935]], [[4050, 4065]], [[4105, 4126]], [[4390, 4396]], [[4663, 4683]], [[5948, 5970]], [[2855, 2860], [2886, 2891], [3861, 3866], [4796, 4801], [6082, 6087], [6130, 6135]], [[6249, 6263]]]"

"The COCO Simulator is a free-of-charge, non-commercial, graphical, modular and CAPE-OPEN compliant, steady-state, sequential simulation process modeling environment. It was originally intended as a test environment for CAPE-OPEN modeling tools but now provides free chemical process simulation for students. It is an open flowsheet modeling environment allowing anyone to add new unit operations or thermodynamics packages. The COCO Simulator uses a graphical representation, the Process Flow Diagram (PFD), for defining the process to be simulated. Clicking on a unit operation with the mouse allows the user to edit the unit operation parameters it defines via the CAPE-OPEN standard or to open the unit operation's own user interface, when available. This interoperability of process modeling software was enabled by the advent of the CAPE-OPEN standard. COCO thermodynamic library ""TEA"" and its chemical compound data bank are based on ChemSep p. 13-53 LITE, a free equilibrium column simulator for distillation columns and liquid-liquid extractors. COCO's thermodynamic library exports more than 100 property calculation methods with their analytical or numerical derivatives. COCO includes a LITE version of COSMOtherm, an activity coefficient model based on Ab initio quantum chemistry methods. The simulator entails a set of unit-operations such as stream splitters/mixers, heat-exchangers, compressors, pumps and reactors. COCO features a reaction numerics package to power its simple conversion, equilibrium, CSTR, Gibbs minimization and plug flow reactor models. ==See also== *Process design (chemical engineering) *List of Chemical Process Simulators *Thermodynamic and thermophysical data *Standard temperature and pressure ==References== ==External links== *Homepage of the COCO Simulator *CO-LaN - the CAPE-OPEN Laboratories Network is a neutral industry and academic association promoting open interface standards in process simulation software.

"Harswell is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Everingham, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is approximately west of Market Weighton town centre, south of Pocklington town centre, and west of the A614 road. In 1931 the parish had a population of 78. In 1823 Harswell was a village and civil parish in the Wapentake of Harthill. Population at the time was 78, with occupations that included five farmers, and a carrier who operated between the village and Market Weighton once a week. On 1 April 1935 the parish was abolished and merged with Everingham. The village church is dedicated to St Peter. There has been a church in Harswell from the late 12th century and the building that was present in 1823 was described by Baines as ""a small ancient structure"". It was rebuilt in 1870-1871 and parish records, dating back to 1653, are held by the Borthwick Institute in York. Harswell was served by Everingham railway station on the Selby to Driffield Line between 1853 and 1954.

"Jarmo Kekäläinen (born July 3, 1966) is a Finnish professional ice hockey executive and former player who briefly played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators. Kekäläinen serves as the general manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets. ==Playing career== Kekäläinen began his hockey career in his native Finland, playing for four years in Finland with a number of teams as well as for Finland in the 1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship. Kekäläinen then played for the Clarkson Golden Knights for three years, establishing himself and gaining interest from professional teams. In his second year with the Knights, he scored 44 points in 31 games and was named to the ECAC Hockey League first all star team. In his third year with the Knights, he scored 18 points in eight games before signing with the Boston Bruins. Kekäläinen played parts of two seasons with the Bruins before returning to Finland, where he played for another two years. For the 1993-1994 season, Kekäläinen went back to North America, where he signed with the Ottawa Senators. He played briefly with the Senators that season, playing in 28 games. The following season, Kekäläinen played in Sweden before retiring in 1995 because of knee problems which were caused by injuries. ==Executive career== Immediately after retirement Kekäläinen became involved with front office work in many capacities. He was general manager of IFK Helsinki in the Finnish Elite League from 1995 to 1999, during which time IFK won one Kanada-malja and finished as the runner-up to TPS the following year. During this time with IFK, Kekäläinen also worked in several capacities with the Ottawa Senators. After he left Finland in 1999 Kekäläinen became director of player personnel for the Senators until 2002. While with the Senators he helped in selecting future NHL stars Marian Hossa, Martin Havlat, and Ray Emery. In 2002 Kekäläinen joined the St. Louis Blues as assistant general manager and director of amateur scouting, where he helped draft much of the core of the team in the early 2010s, including defenseman Alex Pietrangelo and forwards T. J. Oshie, Patrik Berglund, David Perron, and David Backes. After being passed over for the Blues' general manager job for Doug Armstrong, Kekäläinen returned to Finland to take the general manager job with Jokerit. While with Jokerit, Kekäläinen had an unwritten escape clause with ownership that permitted him to leave if he was offered a general manager job in the NHL. That opportunity came on February 13, 2013, when after Scott Howson was fired the previous day, the Columbus Blue Jackets' president of hockey operations John Davidson, under whom Kekäläinen had worked while with the Blues, hired Kekäläinen to be the new general manager of the Blue Jackets. As a result, Kekäläinen became the first European general manager in the National Hockey League. On April 28, 2021 Kekäläinen was named assistant general manager of Finland's national team for the 2022 Olympic Games. ==Personal life== Kekäläinen has a bachelor's degree in management from Clarkson, and graduated with a M.Sc. (Econ.) in marketing from the University of Tampere in 2000. He was selected as the alumnus of the year in 2018. Kekäläinen has a wife and two daughters. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1983–84 KalPa FIN.2 23 0 1 1 2 — — — — — 1984–85 KalPa FIN.2 35 10 7 17 6 — — — — — 1985–86 Ilves FIN U20 9 12 6 18 4 3 0 1 1 0 1985–86 Ilves SM-l 29 6 6 12 8 — — — — — 1986–87 Ilves FIN U20 12 12 10 22 16 4 0 3 3 6 1986–87 Ilves SM-l 42 3 4 7 4 — — — — — 1987–88 Clarkson University ECAC 32 7 11 18 38 — — — — — 1988–89 Clarkson University ECAC 31 19 25 44 47 — — — — — 1989–90 Boston Bruins NHL 11 2 2 4 8 — — — — — 1989–90 Maine Mariners AHL 18 5 11 16 6 — — — — — 1990–91 Boston Bruins NHL 16 2 1 3 6 — — — — — 1990–91 Maine Mariners AHL 11 2 4 6 4 1 0 1 1 0 1991–92 KalPa SM-l 24 2 8 10 24 — — — — — 1992–93 Tappara SM-l 47 15 12 27 34 — — — — — 1993–94 Ottawa Senators NHL 28 1 5 6 14 — — — — — 1993–94 PEI Senators AHL 18 6 6 12 18 — — — — — 1993–94 SC Rapperswil–Jona SUI.2 — — — — — 1 0 0 0 0 1994–95 Västerås IK SEL 32 2 6 8 32 1 0 0 0 0 SM-l totals 142 26 30 56 70 — — — — — NHL totals 55 5 8 13 28 — — — — — AHL totals 47 13 21 34 28 1 0 1 1 0 ===International=== Year Team Event GP G A Pts PIM 1986 Finland WJC 7 4 3 7 2 1991 Finland CC 6 0 1 1 0 Senior totals 6 0 1 1 0 ==Awards and honors== Award Year All-ECAC Hockey First Team 1988–89 ==References== ==External links== * * St. Louis Blues profile Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Boston Bruins players Category:Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey players Category:Columbus Blue Jackets executives Category:Finnish expatriate ice hockey players in Canada Category:Finnish expatriate ice hockey players in Sweden Category:Finnish expatriate ice hockey players in Switzerland Category:Finnish expatriate ice hockey players in the United States Category:Finnish ice hockey administrators Category:Finnish ice hockey left wingers Category:Ilves players Category:KalPa players Category:Maine Mariners (AHL) players Category:National Hockey League general managers Category:Ottawa Senators executives Category:Ottawa Senators players Category:Prince Edward Island Senators players Category:Ice hockey people from Tampere Category:St. Louis Blues executives Category:St. Louis Blues scouts Category:Tappara players Category:Undrafted National Hockey League players Category:VIK Västerås HK players","['Tampere', 'Ilves', 'Boston Bruins', 'KalPa', 'Tappara', 'Ottawa Senators', 'VIK Västerås HK', 'National Hockey League', 'Columbus Blue Jackets', 'World Junior Ice Hockey Championship', 'Clarkson Golden Knights', 'ECAC Hockey League', 'Sweden', 'Kanada-malja', 'Ray Emery', 'Alex Pietrangelo', 'T.

"Sustainable regional development is the application of sustainable development at a regional, rather than local, national or global level. It differs to regional development per se, as the latter is a term used more generally to describe economic development that emphasises the alleviation of regional disparities. While regional development has an economic and equity emphasis, sustainable regional development seeks to incorporate ecological concerns.

"Interstate 70 (I-70) is a transcontinental Interstate Highway in the United States, stretching from Cove Fort, Utah, to Baltimore, Maryland. In Colorado, the highway traverses an east–west route across the center of the state. In western Colorado, the highway connects the metropolitan areas of Grand Junction and Denver via a route through the Rocky Mountains. In eastern Colorado, the highway crosses the Great Plains, connecting Denver with metropolitan areas in Kansas and Missouri. Bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles, normally prohibited on Interstate Highways, are allowed on those stretches of I-70 in the Rockies where no other through route exists. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) lists the construction of I-70 among the engineering marvels undertaken in the Interstate Highway System and cites four major accomplishments: the section through the Dakota Hogback, Eisenhower Tunnel, Vail Pass, and Glenwood Canyon. The Eisenhower Tunnel, with a maximum elevation of and length of , is the longest mountain tunnel and highest point along the Interstate Highway System. The portion through Glenwood Canyon was completed on October 14, 1992. This was one of the final pieces of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic and is one of the most expensive rural highways per mile built in the country. The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) earned the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers for the completion of I-70 through the canyon. When the Interstate Highway System was in the planning stages, the western terminus of I-70 was proposed to be at Denver. The portion west of Denver was included in the plans after lobbying by Governor Edwin C. Johnson, for whom one of the tunnels along I-70 is named. East of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built along the corridor of U.S. Highway 40 (US 40), one of the original transcontinental U.S. Highways. West of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built along the route of US 6, which was extended into Colorado during the 1930s. ==Route description== thumb|right|alt=A railroad, river and two-tiered highway following a narrow canyon|Westbound I-70 on a viaduct inside Glenwood Canyon, paralleling the Colorado River and former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (now Union Pacific) main line ===Colorado River=== I-70 enters Colorado from Utah, concurrent with US 6 and US 50, on a plateau between the north rim of Ruby Canyon of the Colorado River and the south rim of the Book Cliffs. The plateau ends just past the state line and the highway descends into the Grand Valley, formed by the Colorado River and its tributaries. The Grand Valley is home to several towns and small cities that form the Grand Junction Metropolitan Statistical Area, the largest conurbation in the area regionally known as the Western Slope. The highway directly serves the communities of Fruita, Grand Junction, and Palisade. Grand Junction is the largest city between Denver and Salt Lake City and serves as the economic hub of the area. The freeway passes to the north of downtown, while US 6 and US 50 retain their original routes through downtown. US 6 rejoins I-70 east of Grand Junction; US 50 departs on a course toward Pueblo. I-70 exits the valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that separates the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, the first of several tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved side wall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle. ===Glenwood Canyon=== East of the city of Glenwood Springs, the highway enters Glenwood Canyon. Both the federal and state departments of transportation have praised the engineering achievement required to build the freeway through the narrow gorge while preserving the natural beauty of the canyon. A section of roadway features the No Name Tunnel, Hanging Lake Tunnel, Reverse Curve Tunnel, 40 bridges and viaducts, and miles of retaining walls. Through a significant portion of the canyon, the eastbound lanes extend cantilevered over the Colorado River and the westbound lanes are suspended on a viaduct several feet above the canyon floor. Along this run, the freeway hugs the north bank of the Colorado River, while the Central Corridor of the Union Pacific Railroad (formerly the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad) occupies the south bank. To minimize the hazards along this portion, a command center staffed with emergency response vehicles and tow trucks on standby monitors cameras along the tunnels and viaducts in the canyon. Traffic signals have been placed at strategic locations to stop traffic in the event of an accident, and variable message signs equipped with radar guns will automatically warn motorists exceeding the design speed of one of the curves. ===Rocky Mountains=== The highway departs the Colorado River near Dotsero, the name given to the railroad separation for the two primary mountain crossings, the original via Tennessee Pass/Royal Gorge and the newer and shorter Moffat Tunnel route. I-70 uses a separate route between the two rail corridors. From this junction, I-70 follows the Eagle River toward Vail Pass, at an elevation of . In this canyon, I-70 reaches the western terminus of US 24, which meanders through the Rockies before rejoining I-70. US 24 is known as the Highway of the Fourteeners, from the concentration of mountains exceeding along the highway corridor. Along the ascent, I-70 serves the ski resort town of Vail and the ski areas of Beaver Creek Resort, Vail Ski Resort, and Copper Mountain. thumb|right|alt=Automobiles are driving on a road leading to one of two openings in a building against a mountain. Letters above each opening read ""Johnson Tunnel 1979"" and ""Eisenhower Tunnel 1973"". On the roof of the building, large ventilation hoods are visible.|Entrance to the Eisenhower Tunnel The construction of the freeway over Vail Pass is also listed as an engineering marvel. One of the challenges of this portion is the management of the wildlife that roams this area. Several parts of the approach to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses. At least one underpass is located along a natural migratory path and has been landscaped to encourage deer to cross. The highway descends to Dillon Reservoir, near the town of Frisco, and begins one final ascent to the Eisenhower Tunnel, where the freeway crosses the Continental Divide. At the time of dedication, this tunnel was the highest vehicular tunnel in the world, at . , the facility was still the highest vehicular tunnel in the US. The Eisenhower Tunnel is noted as both the longest mountain tunnel and the highest point on the Interstate Highway System. The tunnel has a command center, staffed with 52 full-time employees, to monitor traffic, remove stranded vehicles, and maintain generators to keep the tunnel's lighting and ventilation systems running in the event of a power failure. Signals are placed at each entrance and at various points inside the tunnel to close lanes or stop traffic in an emergency. There are several active and former ski resorts in the vicinity of the tunnel, including Breckenridge Ski Resort, Keystone Resort, Arapahoe Basin, Loveland Ski Area, Berthoud Pass Ski Area, and Winter Park Resort. ===Clear Creek=== The freeway follows Clear Creek down the eastern side of the Rockies, passing through the Veterans Memorial Tunnels near Idaho Springs. Farther to the east, I-70 departs the US 6 corridor, which continues to follow Clear Creek through a narrow, curving gorge. The Interstate, however, follows the corridor of US 40 out of the canyon. The highway crests a small mountain near Genesee Park to descend into Mount Vernon Canyon to exit the Rocky Mountains. This portion features grade-warning signs with unusual messages, such as ""Trucks: Don't be fooled"", ""Truckers, you are not down yet"", and ""Are your brakes adjusted and cool?"". Runaway truck ramps are a prominent feature along this portion of I-70, with a total of seven used along the descent of either side the Continental Divide to stop trucks with failed brakes. thumb|left|alt=A highway near the top of a ridge. On either side of the highway are big yellow signs reading, ""Trucks, Don't be Fooled—4 more miles [] of steep grades and sharp curves"".|Warning sign stating, ""Trucks, Don't be Fooled—4 more miles [] of steep grades and sharp curves"" The last geographic feature of the Rocky Mountains traversed before the highway reaches the Great Plains is the Dakota Hogback. The path through the hogback features a massive cut that exposes various layers of rock millions of years old. The site includes a nature study area for visitors. ===Great Plains=== As the freeway passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver metropolitan area, part of a larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, US 40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary east–west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US 6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join I-76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets I-25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap. From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 serves—together with those two Interstates—as part of an inner beltway around Denver. I-70 has one official branch in Colorado, I-270, which connects the Interstate with the Denver–Boulder Turnpike. Where these two freeways merge is the busiest portion of I-70 in the state, with an average of 183,000 vehicles per day . While State Highway 470 (SH 470) and E-470 are not officially branches of I-70, they are remnants of plans for an I-470 outer beltway around Denver that were canceled when the allocated funds were spent elsewhere. Leaving Denver, the highway serves the redevelopment areas on the former site of Stapleton International Airport; runway 17R/35L crossed over the Interstate at the runway's midsection. East of Aurora, I-70 rejoins the alignment of US 40 at Colfax Avenue. The freeway proceeds east across the Great Plains, briefly dipping south to serve the city of Limon, which bills itself as Hub City because of the many rail and road arteries that intersect there. I-70 enters Kansas near Burlington, a small community known for having one of the oldest carousels in the United States. ==History== In 1944, a report to the United States Congress outlined several interregional highways, among which was a freeway from the east along the US 40 corridor that ended in Denver. After Colorado officials lobbied successfully, the designation was extended west over the Rocky Mountains following US 6. The origins of both the US 40 and US 6 predate the United States Numbered Highway System, using established transcontinental trails. ===Earlier routes=== Before the formation of the US Highway System, the country relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the auto trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in Wyoming or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies in Wyoming, officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska, enter Colorado, and return to the main route in Wyoming. While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed. After losing the connection to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway to traverse the state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered US 40. While US 6 was also one of the original 1926 US Highways, the road originally served the portion of the country east of the Rocky Mountains. The highway was not extended to the Pacific coast until 1937, mostly following the Midland Trail. Around the time the U.S. Highway system was formed, the portion of the Midland Trail through Glenwood Canyon, known as the Taylor State Road, was destroyed by a flood. When US 6 was extended, the Works Progress Administration was rebuilding the road through the canyon and the Public Works Administration was nearing completion of a new highway over Vail Pass. In western Colorado, US 6 was routed concurrent with US 50 from the Utah state line to Grand Junction and eventually replaced US 24 from Grand Junction to near Vail. To keep these routes over the Rockies competitive with alternatives in other states, the Colorado Department of Highways relied on ingenuity to keep the roads safe. The department pioneered new machines to clear snow and various bridge and culvert designs to protect the roads from flooding. ===Interstate Highway planning=== Governor Edwin C. Johnson, for whom one of the tunnels along I-70 was later named, was a primary force in persuading the planners of the Interstate Highway System to extend the highway across the state. He stated to the Senate subcommittee in 1955: > You are going to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You are going to > build two four-lane highways through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs > to be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to take > anything away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, > either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive > highways for the East and West to travel on. Colorado held several meetings to convince reluctant Utah officials they would benefit from a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link would be difficult to build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US 40, US 6, and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US 50/US 285/US 24\. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US 6 corridor. Under this proposal, the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas. Congress approved the extension of I-70; however, the route still had to be approved by the representatives of the military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central part of the country to Southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners approved the extension but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route. ===Construction=== thumb|right|alt=Several mountains with scars from roads visible at the base and up the sides|View from Loveland Pass, showing a hairpin turn along the US 6 alignment on top right, and the straighter I-70 emerging from the Eisenhower Tunnel on the left The first Colorado portion of I-70 opened to traffic in 1961. This section bypassed and linked Idaho Springs to the junction where US 6 currently separates from I-70 west of the city. The majority of the alignment through Denver was completed by 1964. The Mousetrap reused some structures that were built in 1951, before the formation of the Interstate Highway System. The last piece east of Denver opened to traffic in 1977. ====Eisenhower Tunnel==== Planning on how to route the freeway over the Rocky Mountains began in the early 1960s. The US 6 corridor crosses two passes: Loveland Pass, at an elevation of , and Vail Pass, at . Engineers recommended tunneling under Loveland Pass to bypass the steep grades and hairpin curves required to navigate US 6\. The project was originally called the Straight Creek Tunnel, after the waterway that runs along the western approach. The tunnel was later renamed the Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel, after President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Colorado Governor Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks, and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. A total of nine workers were killed during the construction of both bores. Further complicating construction was that the boring machines could not work as fast as expected at such high altitudes, and the productivity was significantly less than planned. The frustration prompted one engineer to comment, ""We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn't read."" The first bore was dedicated March 8, 1973. Initially, this tunnel was used for two-way traffic, with one lane for each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions, and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the second tube (the Johnson bore), which was finished on December 21, 1979. The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $42 million; the actual cost was $108 million (equivalent to $ in ). Approximately 90 percent of the funds were paid by the federal government, with the state of Colorado paying the rest. At the time, this figure set a record for the most expensive federally aided project. The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $102.8 million (equivalent to $ in ). The tunnel construction became involved in the women's rights movement due to advocacy by Janet Bonnema after she was subjected to gender-based discrimination after being hired as an engineering technician for the construction of the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel due to the miners' superstition that women who entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972, Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action suit against CDOT, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As Colorado voters had passed the Equal Rights Amendment that year, the state settled Bonnema's case out of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily walk off the job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened. ====Vail Pass==== While designing the Eisenhower Tunnel, controversies erupted over how to build the portions over Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon. The route of US 6 over Vail Pass has a distinctive ""V"" shape. Initially, engineers thought they could shorten the route of I-70 by about by tunneling from Gore Creek to South Willow Creek, an alternative known as the Red Buffalo Tunnel. This alternative sparked a nationwide controversy as it would require an easement across federally protected lands, through what is now called the Eagles Nest Wilderness. After the US Secretary of Agriculture refused to grant the easement, the engineers agreed to follow the existing route across Vail Pass. The engineers added infrastructure to accommodate wildlife and had significant portions of the viaducts constructed offsite and lifted in place to minimize the environmental footprint. The grade over Vail Pass reaches seven percent. ====Glenwood Canyon==== Glenwood Canyon has served as the primary transportation artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. Highways. Railroads have used the canyon since 1887, and a dirt road was built through the canyon in the early 20th century. The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). With the Eisenhower Tunnel finished, the last remaining obstacle for I-70 to be an interstate commercial artery was the two lane, non-freeway portion in Glenwood Canyon. Construction had started on this section in the 1960s with a small section opening to traffic in 1966. The remainder was stopped due to environmentalist protests that caused a 30-year controversy. The original design was criticized as ""the epitome of environmental insensitivity"". Engineers scrapped the original plans and started work on a new design that would minimize additional environmental impacts. A new design was underway by 1971, which was approved in 1975; however, environmental groups filed lawsuits to stop construction, and the controversy continued even when construction finally resumed in 1981. The final design included 40 bridges and viaducts, three additional tunnel bores (two were completed before construction was stopped in the 1960s), and of retaining walls for a stretch of freeway long. The project was further complicated by the need to build the four-lane freeway without disturbing the operations of the railroad. This required using special and coordinated blasting techniques. Engineers designed two separate tracks for the highway, one elevated above the other, to minimize the footprint in the canyon. The final design was praised for its environmental sensitivity. A Denver architect who helped design the freeway proclaimed, ""Most of the people in western Colorado see it as having preserved the canyon."" He further stated, ""I think pieces of the highway elevate to the standard of public art."" A portion of the project included shoring up the banks of the Colorado River to repair damage and remove flow restrictions created in the initial construction of US 6 in the 1930s. The freeway was finally completed on October 14, 1992, in a ceremony covered nationwide. Most coverage celebrated the engineering achievement or noted this was the last major piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic. However, newspapers in western Colorado celebrated the end of the frustrating traffic delays. For most of the final 10 years of construction, only a single lane of traffic that reversed direction every 30 minutes remained open in the canyon. One newspaper proudly proclaimed ""You heard right. For the first time in more than 10 years, construction delays along that stretch of Interstate 70 will be non-existent."" The cost was $490 million (equivalent to $ in ) to build , 40 times the average cost per mile predicted by the planners of the Interstate Highway System. This figure exceeded that of I-15 through the Virgin River Gorge, which was previously proclaimed the most expensive rural freeway in the country. The construction of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon earned 30 awards for CDOT, including the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers. At the dedication, it was claimed that I-70 through Glenwood Canyon was the final piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic. For this reason, the system was proclaimed to be complete. However, at the time, there were still two sections of the original Interstate Highway System that had not been constructed: a section of I-95 in central New Jersey, that was not completed until 2018, and a section of I-70 in Breezewood, Pennsylvania. ===Incidents=== On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedos for the US Navy overturned while navigating a ramp at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange. The situation was made worse as no one answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking from one of the torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, US Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by the state police, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway System, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987, and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003. In 2014, mile-marker 420 was altered by CDOT to read ""Mile 419.99"" following repeat thefts of the original sign due to the significance of the number 420 in cannabis culture. In 2019, a fiery crash killed four people and injured dozens. A previous, non-fatal accident in Wheat Ridge had resulted in backed up traffic for several miles. At the time of the second collision, the backup extended into Lakewood past the Colorado Mills Parkway exit. A semi-trailer truck descending the grades as the freeway entered the greater Denver area, driven by Rogel Aguilera Mederos, attempted to downshift, but he was unable re-engage the transmission. This resulted in the vehicle rapidly increasing in speed, with witnesses seeing the truck out of control near the Genesee exit, from where the accident would occur. Witnesses also testified seeing the brakes smoking while the truck descended the hill. The driver passed at least one runaway truck ramp without entering, as well as four other exits where he could have exited the freeway. As the truck approached the backed up traffic, the driver attempted to swerve to the side of the road to avoid a collision but was unable as other trucks had already blocked this path while similarly attempting to avoid a collision. The truck collided with the backup and exploded. Over a dozen other vehicles were involved in the collision and four people died. The driver was charged with numerous offenses, including assault and vehicular homicide and initially sentenced to 110 years. This was controversial, due to the length of the sentence and the opinions of some victims and witnesses that the owner of the truck bore more responsibility. The company had previously been fined and cited for numerous brake-related violations as well as employing inexperienced truck drivers who were not fluent in English. Aguilera testified through an interpreter in his own defense and pleaded for mercy saying, ""I ask God too many times why them and not me? Why did I survive that accident?"". He also blamed his employer, testifying he was instructed to take back roads from the trip's origin in Wyoming and avoid the more commonly used road from Wyoming, I-25. Shortly after the accident, CDOT announced a location for an additional runaway truck ramp in this area. After the 2020 Grizzly Creek Fire, I-70 was closed in Glenwood Canyon in August 2021 due to significant damage by debris from the fire, causing large detours. The damage after the 2021 landslides required lengthy reconstruction of the road; the highway partially reopened on August 14, 2021. ===Legacy=== When first approved, the extension of I-70 from Denver to Cove Fort was criticized in some area newspapers as a road to nowhere; an information liaison specialist with USDOT in Baltimore, Maryland—the eastern terminus of I-70—claims people have asked ""did we think Baltimoreans were so desperate to get to Cove Fort that we were willing to pay $4 billion to get them there?"". However, a resident engineer with USDOT has called the extension one of the ""crown jewels"" of the Interstate Highway System. In Colorado, the freeway helped unite the state, despite the two halves being separated by the formidable Rocky Mountains. The Eisenhower Tunnel alone is credited with saving up to an hour from the drive across the state. Prior to I-70's construction, the highway through Glenwood Canyon was one of the most dangerous in the state. With the improvements, the accident rate has dropped 40 percent even though traffic through the canyon has substantially increased. CDOT is considering the nomination of various portions of I-70 as a National Historic Landmark, even though the freeway will not qualify as historical for several decades. thumb|I-70 through the Colorado Plateau The freeway is credited with enhancing Colorado's ski industry. The ski resort town of Vail did not exist until I-70 began construction, with developers working in close partnership with CDOT. By 1984, the I-70 corridor between Denver and Grand Junction contained the largest concentration of ski resorts in the country. The towns and cities along the corridor have experienced significant growth, luring recreational visitors from the Denver area. As one conservationist lamented, I-70 ""changed rural Colorado into non- rural Colorado"". ==Future== CDOT is replacing a viaduct that formerly carried I-70 between Brighton Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard in Denver with a below- grade highway. The $1.2 billion project, financed through a public–private partnership with Kiewit and Meridiam, would add a new express toll lane and build frontage roads; the below-grade freeway would have a park built over the top between Clayton and Columbine streets. Traffic was moved onto the new alignment in late 2022; however, the project is not expected to be fully complete until 2023. ==Exit list== ==See also== *Business routes of Interstate 70 in Colorado ==References== ==External links== * I-70 Road conditions, construction updates, traffic cameras, and traveler alerts by Colorado Department of Transportation * I-70 Guide by AARoads * Glenwood Canyon: An I-70 OdysseyHistory of the Canyon and Construction of I-70 by Matthew E.

"The Polar Line (, ) is an incomplete and abandoned railway line in Norway, from Fauske to Narvik and, if finished, ultimately would have run to Kirkenes. The railway was constructed by the Wehrmacht in occupied Norway during the Second World War as part of Festung Norwegen. At Fauske, the line connected with the Nordland Line, and construction stretched as far north as Drag, Tysfjord. After the war, the plans were abandoned by Norwegian authorities, although from the 1970s, they were revitalized as part of the proposed Northern Norway Line. Some tunnels and bridges remain and part of the route has been used to build European Road E6. ==Route== Organizationally, the construction of the Polar Line started at Finneid. It ran through the Bratthaugen Tunnel before reaching Fauske, where Fauske Station was planned. At the time of German capitulation on 8 May 1945, most of the right-of-way through Fauske was completed. The line continued northwards, crossed Svartosen on a bridge and continued to the lake of Vallvatnet. There, a passing loop station was planned. The line continued to Straumen, where a station was planned north of the village. A power-station was built at Røyrvatnet. The line continued past the lake of Hellandsjøen. On the section from Hellandsjøen to Buvik, five tunnels were planned as well as a station at Hellbukta. At Megården, from Fauske, of Megården Tunnel were built. At Trengsel, from Fauske, the Trengsel Bridge was planned. After passing Torkildseng, from Fauske, the line was to run through two short tunnels. Stations were planned Løktehaugen and Kvarv, from Fauske, respectively. Between the two stations 18 tunnels were planned. A power station was built at Kvarv. The line was planned to run through the Espenes Tunnel before reaching the next station at Kalvik, from Fauske. The next station was to be at Sommerset, from Fauske, followed by a station at Lappstorvik and then reached Sørfjord. The next two stations were at Kobbvatnet and Gjerdalen, after which the line would have run through the Basis Tunnel and the Sildhopfjell Tunnel, the latter from Fauske. It would have then continued through the Tennvatn Tunnel, the Tennvatn Tunnel and the Falkelva Tunnel. Stations would have been built at Kråkmo and Sandnes, from Fauske, respectively. The line would then run through the Hellarvik Tunnel just before reaching at station at Tømmernes, from Fauske. At from Fauske lay the Trollpollhaugen Tunnel after which the station reached Drag, from Fauske. From Bjørnfjell, the line would have hugged the Norway–Sweden border into the county of Troms, before running down the Salangsdalen valley. It would pass through the villages of Setermoen and Andselv before running west of the lake of Takvatnet. It would then have reached Balsfjorden, which it would have hugged until reaching Nordkjosbotn. It would cross across Balsfjordeidet to Storfjorden, which is would follow on the east shore of. There it would have passed through the village of Skibotn and run around the Kåfjorden and through Kåfjordbotn. It would then have run along Rotsundet and reach Nordreisa, which would have been located form Bjørnfjell. The line would have continued down the valley of Reisadalen, following the river of Reisaelva for about , at which point it would make a large S-bend around the lake of Ráisjávri. It would then run to from Nordreisa to Kautokeino, from where it would run north- eastwards. It would then have crossed the plateau of Finnmarksvidda and reached Karasjok, from Nordreisa. The line would then have run northwards, running along the Finland–Norway border and the Tana River until reaching Skiippagurra, from Nordreisa. From there, it would have run along the south shore of Varangerfjorden and around Kjøfjorden until reaching Kirkenes. ==History== ===Planning=== The Nordland Line, which was originally proposed to run from Trondheim to Helgeland, was first launched by Ole Tobias Olsen in 1872. By 1892, surveying on parts of the route had been started. The first specific plans for a railway north of Fauske was presented by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in 1901, which proposed the line be built to Røsvik with a branch to Bodø. The first part of the Nordland Line, the Hell–Sunnan Line, was completed in 1905. In the Railway Plan of 1923, a line between Fauske and Narvik was included and estimated to cost 160 million Norwegian krone (NOK). At the same time, the Standing Committee on Railways stated that the Nordland Line would not meet its function until it had crossed Finnmark. A report on the section from Narvik to Kvesmenes was published in March 1923, followed by the section from Kvesmenes to Alteidet in June 1926, Alteidet to Porsangerfjorden in December 1926, from Porsangerfjorden to Tana in June 1927, from Tana to Vadsø in January 1928 and from Nyborg to Kirkenes in April 1928. The distance from Fauske to Vadsø was and from Fauske to Kirkenes . Construction was estimated to NOK 375 million. NSB completed the Nordland Line to Mosjøen in 1940. Following the German occupation of Norway, construction of the line was accelerated. On 11 December 1940, the Reichskommissariat Norwegen requested that NSB submit their plans. The plans north to Narvik were sent 21 March 1941 and the plans to Kirkenes on 20 January 1942. NSB had three different proposals for the route between Fauske and Narvik. The first—the Ferry Line—was a railway from Fauske to Korsnes on Tysfjorden and onwards to Narvik by train ferry. It would also include a ferry terminal at Tjeldsundet, where there would be a connection northwards towards Kirkenes. The second alternative—the Fjord Line—would run via Tømmerneset, Innhavet and Musken, around the southern end of Tysfjorden and then followed the shoreline to Ballangen to Narvik. The third—the Mountain Line—would follow an inland route from Kobbvatnet up Gerdalen and then through a long tunnel to Tysfjorden. The Fjord Line was longer than the Mountain Line, but considerably cheaper to build. A fourth proposal, launched by the Wehrmacht, was to build a ferry crossing of Tysfjorden, but otherwise build closely to that of the Fjord Line. The alternatives were considered by Vienna-based Ladislaus von Rabcewicz. He considered the alternatives based on that the railway would be extended to Kirkenes, that the railway should be built as quickly as possible, and considering the line's strategic location. Of military-strategic concerns, he discarded the proposals which involved a ferry. The Fjord Line was considered advantageous gradients and close access to the fjords would allow for more work days per year. However, it had four tunnels longer than , five tunnels between , three tunnels between , five tunnels between and twelve tunnels shorter than . Rabcewicz stated that it would be necessary with immediate start of construction for all tunnels longer than , with the establishment of 24 breaking-in points. Rabcewicz recommended a mountain line, but chose to build it to intersect with the Ofoten Line at Bjørnfjell, and use that line as a branch to reach Narvik, rather than build the line directly to the town. The Mountain Line could be built faster because of shorter tunnels, the longest being , which with an estimated per day would give a construction time of 33 months. The other main advantage of the line was that it lay so far inland that an Allied attack would be improbable. However, Rabcewicz noted several disadvantages of the line, including steeper gradients, the lack of any fjords or residents between Kobbvatnet and Bjrnfjell and the increased amount of snow in the area. He estimated that the line could be completed by June 1945 given a work-force of 83,700 men. Planning of the route from Narvik to Kirkenes was led by Professor Flörke in Narvik. The first report was published on 4 July 1942, regarding the route from Kvesmenes to Skibotn. The report considered three proposals, that of NSB from the 1920s, that of the Reichskommissariat's railway division and that of the Flörke's group. NSB had recommended a route which followed the coastline, but Flörke stated that for military-strategic reasons this route had to be discarded. He further wanted to avoid long tunnels to decrease construction time. He also remarked that NSB's maps did not match the terrain, forcing his office to take aerial photography of the route from Nordreisa to Skippagurra between May and August 1942, while Narvik to Nordreisa was photographed between June and August. Plans consisting of the section from Setermoen to Nordreisa ( from Bjørnfjell) were sent to Einsatzgruppe Wiking in Oslo on 8 July 1942. The plans from Bjørnfjell to Setermoen were sent on 23 July. ===Construction=== As part of Operation Barbarossa—the German invasion of the Soviet Union—plans were immediately dispatched to complete a railway to Kirkenes. The responsibility was given to Organisation Todt. Plans called for the Nordland Line to be completed to Rognan on 1 August 1943 and later that same year to Fauske. Construction of the section north of Fauske was, unlike the section southwards, without any Norwegian participation, including that of NSB. Construction was organized by Einsatzgruppe Wiking which was based in Mo i Rana and had clerks of works in Fauske and Tømmerneset. The work was performed through a number of German construction companies. Construction on the Polar Line started in January 1943. The first part of construction was for auxiliary facilities, such as barracks, quays and power supply. The workforce largely provided by Russian and Serbian prisoners of war (POW). Despite the enormous amount of labour construction of the railway was notoriously inefficient and the part of the railway which were completed further south was of such bad quality that most of the permanent way had to be replaced. North of Tysfjorden, the only work was a tote road between Narvik and Bjørnfjell. The area the line was being built was without road connection, and the steep terrain made it difficult to place the railway elsewhere than close by the fjords. As this was also the place where people lived, it caused a conflict of interest. According to the peace-time compulsory purchase law, the state was forced to pay due compensation for any land they needed to build public infrastructure. However, the Germans showed no interest in following these laws, took what property they needed, often without even informing the locals. In Lappstorvika, the road became so dilapidated that the locals chose to move away until after the war. Thirty thousand POWs were brought to work on the railway through Norland. The treatment of the POWs varied depending on their nationality, their status in regard to the Geneva Convention and their alignment. Russians who converted to support Andrey Vlasov were treated better and often sent to own camps. Similarly, only two of over 1,000 Polish POWs in Nordland died, and were treated better because Polish people were generally regarded as pro-Axis. Wehrmacht invested the equivalent of NOK 15 million in labour and other costs in the line. At the time of the German capitulation on 8 May 1945 there were an estimated 8,300 POWs living in camps on the segment between Fauske and Drag. About ten percent of those who had worked on the line had died. On 4 December 1945, the Embassy of the Soviet Union in Oslo and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs started work on a common Norwegian–Soviet commission which would investigate issues regarding Russian POWs in Norway. The commission was established in March 1946. Both NSB and Norwegian authorities were concerned that the Soviet goal was to claim compensation for the effective work which the POWs had done in Norway. Although vague estimates of the number of man-hours were calculated, no monetary value was ever determined, and no claim was submitted to the Norwegian authorities from the Soviet Union. ==Legacy== The Nordland Line was completed to Bodø in 1962. In the 1960s, Parliament voted to pause any further plans to build a railway northwards for ten years. Instead, the road network was to be expanded. Starting in the 1970s, a series of regional airports were built, largely undermining the need for the railway for passenger transport. In 1968, NSB again considered the Northern Norway Line, a proposal to extend the Nordland Line from Fauske via Narvik to Harstad and Tromsø. The Ministry of Transport and Communications recommended that the line not be built. However, during the 1970s, income from petroleum production started a public debate as to whether the income should be used on domestic infrastructure investments. In 1977, the Ribu Commission was established to look into building a new railway north of Fauske. The commission made no clear recommendation as to whether the line should be built, but stated although it had a cost of NOK 4.4 billion and would need operating subsidies, it would provide a positive economic impact on the region, particularly if additional industrial and commercial investments were made along the route. Parliament did not make a decision when it debated the commission's report in 1983. Instead, a new report was issued in 1992. This time it was planned as a high-speed railway, but in 1994, the project was rejected by Parliament. When the E6 highway was built northwards from Fauske during the 1960s, parts of the right-of-way built for the Polar Line was used for the road. Specifically, the highway follows the railway route from Fauske past Vallvatnet to a point beyond Straumen, in addition to a section of the right-of-way past Torkilseng. The road also used tunnels built at Asp, Eva, Espenes, Kobbvatnet and north of Tømmerneset. ==2019 study== In 2019, the Norwegian Railway Directorate signed an agreement with Asplan Viak to study the development of a line from Fauske via Narvik to Tromsø. The Fauske – Tromsø Line would be around 375 km long, while the Bjerkvik – Harstad line would be just over 80 km long. The analyses found the full scheme development would cost NKr 113bn, while the line to Harstad would cost around NKr 20bn. The analysis showed that it would cost more than NKr 100bn ($US 11.6bn). However, the Norwegian Railway Directorate says the line will not be economically viable, as calculations show a net loss for the state of between NKr 46bn and NKr 109bn. ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * * * * ==External links== * Private site with many pictures Category:Railway lines in Norway Category:Norway in World War II Category:Railway lines in Nordland","['Railway', 'Fauske', 'Norway', 'Narvik', 'Kirkenes', 'Wehrmacht', 'Second World War', 'Festung Norwegen', 'Nordland Line', 'Tysfjord', 'Finneid', 'Røyrvatnet', 'Hellandsjøen', 'Trengsel Bridge', 'Kalvik', 'Kobbvatnet', 'Norway–Sweden border', 'Troms', 'Salangsdalen', 'Setermoen', 'Andselv', 'Balsfjorden', 'Nordkjosbotn', 'Skibotn', 'Kåfjordbotn', 'Nordreisa', 'Reisadalen', 'Reisaelva', 'Kautokeino', 'Finnmarksvidda', 'Karasjok', 'Skiippagurra', 'Varangerfjorden', 'Trondheim', 'Helgeland', 'Ole Tobias Olsen', 'Røsvik', 'Bodø', 'Hell–Sunnan Line', 'Norwegian krone', 'Finnmark', 'Alteidet', 'Porsangerfjorden', 'Mosjøen', 'Reichskommissariat Norwegen', 'Korsnes', 'Tjeldsundet', 'Tømmerneset', 'Musken', 'Vienna', 'Ladislaus von Rabcewicz', 'Ofoten Line', 'Operation Barbarossa', 'Organisation Todt', 'Rognan', 'Mo i Rana', 'Geneva Convention', 'Andrey Vlasov', 'Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Harstad', 'Tromsø']","['Q3565868', 'Q48696', 'Q20', 'Q1215658', 'Q209423', 'Q128781', 'Q362', 'Q930800', 'Q1634815', 'Q493851', 'Q3676072', 'Q3671741', 'Q5706934', 'Q3610533', 'Q130379', 'Q3702106', 'Q2742785', 'Q50631', 'Q3700965', 'Q1994507', 'Q2314903', 'Q3734493', 'Q2376593', 'Q1634337', 'Q2904551', 'Q494059', 'Q11997505', 'Q1603703', 'Q6459', 'Q940402', 'Q1825', 'Q1815185', 'Q384858', 'Q25804', 'Q1480452', 'Q1772896', 'Q2204847', 'Q221119', 'Q5709183', 'Q132643', 'Q50632', 'Q2840324', 'Q925268', 'Q851998', 'Q335200', 'Q3199016', 'Q2559252', 'Q3440288', 'Q3328833', 'Q1741', 'Q87359', 'Q1082916', 'Q83055', 'Q155433', 'Q2162122', 'Q59169', 'Q133536', 'Q157615', 'Q2982622', 'Q62140', 'Q26087']","[[[4102, 4109], [4281, 4288], [4450, 4457], [13745, 13752], [14209, 14216], [14465, 14472], [14530, 14537]], [[80, 86], [278, 284], [779, 785], [793, 799], [904, 910], [1366, 1372], [1423, 1429], [1496, 1502], [1601, 1607], [1813, 1819], [1867, 1873], [2101, 2107], [2271, 2277], [2397, 2403], [2413, 2419], [2494, 2500], [4058, 4064], [4318, 4324], [4878, 4884], [4907, 4913], [5356, 5362], [5419, 5425], [9010, 9016], [9055, 9061], [9265, 9271], [11222, 11228], [12359, 12365], [12739, 12745], [13346, 13352], [13502, 13508], [13842, 13848], [13875, 13881]], [[67, 73], [211, 217], [534, 540], [2550, 2556], [3595, 3601], [5062, 5068], [11519, 11525], [11720, 11726], [12302, 12308], [14482, 14488], [14498, 14504]], [[90, 96], [4329, 4335], [4577, 4583], [5223, 5229], [5367, 5373], [5466, 5472], [5779, 5785], [7077, 7083], [7733, 7739], [7783, 7789], [8433, 8439], [9891, 9897], [12370, 12376], [13853, 13859]], [[144, 152], [3781, 3789], [4836, 4844], [4917, 4925], [5271, 5279], [5597, 5605], [6301, 6309], [7743, 7751], [8843, 8851]], [[189, 198], [6038, 6047], [11004, 11013]], [[229, 245]], [[257, 273]], [[314, 327], [3822, 3835], [4214, 4227], [4475, 4488], [4993, 5006], [8925, 8938], [11930, 11943], [12340, 12353]], [[378, 386], [5440, 5448], [5720, 5728], [5906, 5914], [6082, 6090], [9841, 9849]], [[716, 723]], [[1182, 1192]], [[1230, 1242], [1264, 1276]], [[1435, 1450]], [[1800, 1806]], [[1969, 1979], [5849, 5859], [7542, 7552], [13670, 13680]], [[2550, 2570]], [[2590, 2595], [12392, 12397], [13863, 13868], [13884, 13889]], [[2621, 2633]], [[2680, 2689], [8532, 8541], [8661, 8670]], [[2694, 2701]], [[2775, 2786]], [[2830, 2842]], [[2991, 2998], [7876, 7883]], [[3040, 3051]], [[3102, 3111], [3366, 3375], [3517, 3526], [3662, 3671], [8373, 8382], [8443, 8452], [8545, 8554]], [[3209, 3219]], [[3244, 3253]], [[3379, 3389]], [[3475, 3489]], [[3502, 3510]], [[3643, 3655]], [[3728, 3743]], [[3879, 3888]], [[3892, 3901]], [[3925, 3941]], [[4162, 4168]], [[4186, 4190], [11961, 11965]], [[4233, 4249]], [[4383, 4398]], [[3475, 3483], [4538, 4546]], [[4668, 4676], [4691, 4699]], [[4703, 4719], [4743, 4759]], [[5010, 5017]], [[5137, 5164]], [[5429, 5436]], [[5531, 5542]], [[5659, 5670], [9276, 9287], [13694, 13705]], [[5685, 5691]], [[6185, 6191]], [[6198, 6221]], [[7011, 7022]], [[8723, 8743]], [[8885, 8902]], [[8958, 8964]], [[9228, 9237]], [[10721, 10738]], [[10794, 10807]], [[11371, 11408]], [[12380, 12387], [13946, 13953], [14077, 14084]], [[12392, 12398], [13863, 13869], [13884, 13890]]]"
"Franz Heinrich Schwechten (12 August 1841 – 11 August 1924) was one of the most famous German architects of the Wilhelmine era, and contributed to the development of historicist architecture. ==Life== Schwechten was born in Cologne, the son of a district court judge. He attended Gymnasium, taking his Abitur in 1860, and went on to work as an apprentice of master builder Julius Carl Raschdorff, who would later design the new Berlin Cathedral. In 1861, Schwechten enrolled in the Bauakademie (Academy of Architecture) in Berlin, where he studied under Karl Bötticher and Friedrich Adler. During a practical training period following the completion of his studies in December 1863, Schwechten worked first for several months with Friedrich August Stüler, until May 1864, and then with Martin Gropius, until June 1865.Zietz, Peer (1999). Franz Heinrich Schwechten: ein Architekt zwischen Historismus und Moderne. Stuttgart: Edition Axel Menges. p. 12.thumb|upright|Imperial Castle, Poznań|leftIn 1868, Schwechten received an award from the Berlin Architect's Union for the Neoclassical design of a Prussian Parliament building. The next year, he graduated as a master builder and began his career as chief architect of the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company. His first major work was the monumental Anhalter Bahnhof terminus opened in 1880, then the largest station building in Continental Europe. Among his works were the designs of Tyszkiewicz Palace in Palanga (Polangen) and the Imperial Castle in Poznań (Posen). One of the most notable of Schwechten's designs was the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (completed in 1895), with its tower and distinct Neo-Romanesque style elements. Schwechten became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1885, and served as its president from 1915 to 1918.Zietz (1999), p. 18-19, 117. In 1904 he was honored with the title of ""Geheimer Baurat"" (privy building officer), and in 1906 he was named a professor.Zietz (1999), p. 25. He served as a lecturer at the Royal Polytechnic University in Charlottenburg. Schwechten died in Berlin and was buried in Schöneberg. ==Selected works== *Lutherstadt Wittenberg railway station building, 1877 *Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof, 1880, ruins except for portico blown up in 1959 *Prussian Military Academy, Berlin, 1883, ruins demolished in 1976 *Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, Charlottenburg, 1895, tower preserved *Tiškevičiai Palace, Palanga, 1897 *Grunewald Tower, 1899 *Romanesque House, Charlottenburg, 1901, destroyed in World War II *Kaiserbrücke, Mainz, 1904, towers demolished *Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg, 1908 *South Bridge (Cologne), 1910 *Imperial Castle in Poznań, 1910 *Hohenzollern Bridge, 1911, towers demolished *Haus Vaterland, Berlin, 1912, ruins demolished in 1976 *Christuskirche, Rome, 1922 ==References== Category:1841 births Category:1924 deaths Category:Architects from Cologne Category:People from the Rhine Province Category:19th-century German architects","['Cologne', 'Rhine Province', 'Berlin', 'Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof', 'Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church', 'Tiškevičiai Palace, Palanga', 'Imperial Castle in Poznań', 'Abitur', 'Julius Carl Raschdorff', 'Berlin Cathedral', 'Bauakademie', 'Karl Bötticher', 'Friedrich August Stüler', 'Martin Gropius', 'Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company', 'Palanga', 'Poznań', 'Prussian Academy of Arts', 'Schöneberg', 'Lutherstadt Wittenberg railway station', 'Prussian Military Academy', 'Grunewald Tower', 'World War II', 'Kaiserbrücke, Mainz', 'Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg', 'Hohenzollern Bridge', 'Haus Vaterland', 'Christuskirche, Rome']","['Q365', 'Q698162', 'Q64', 'Q695244', 'Q153951', 'Q2968020', 'Q322605', 'Q708387', 'Q69715', 'Q154563', 'Q51984', 'Q87902', 'Q61256', 'Q69384', 'Q821036', 'Q2047414', 'Q268', 'Q514802', 'Q313189', 'Q801132', 'Q144242', 'Q833787', 'Q362', 'Q328874', 'Q630576', 'Q696762', 'Q1590621', 'Q763543']","[[[224, 231], [2616, 2623], [2876, 2883]], [[2909, 2923]], [[428, 434], [523, 529], [1040, 1046], [1223, 1229], [2064, 2070], [2176, 2182], [2277, 2283], [2727, 2733]], [[2176, 2199]], [[1569, 1599], [2317, 2347]], [[2388, 2415]], [[1478, 1503], [2632, 2657]], [[302, 308]], [[373, 395]], [[428, 444]], [[482, 493]], [[554, 568]], [[731, 754]], [[786, 800]], [[1223, 1252]], [[1451, 1458], [2408, 2415]], [[982, 988], [1497, 1503], [2651, 2657]], [[1714, 1738]], [[2089, 2099]], [[2121, 2159]], [[2250, 2275]], [[2423, 2438]], [[2499, 2511]], [[2513, 2532]], [[2559, 2594]], [[2665, 2684]], [[2711, 2725]], [[2767, 2787]]]"
"Rail Business Intelligence was a fortnightly subscription newsletter for senior managers, investors, lawyers, contractors, consultants, local authorities, trade unionists, manufacturers and service providers working in the United Kingdom's rail industry. After 23 years and 554 issues the final print edition was produced in March 2018, and Railway Gazette Group's UK news is now published online as Rail Business UK. == History == Rail Business Intelligence was launched in March 1995 as Rail Privatisation News, with Roger Ford as Founding Editor. Initially conceived as a short-term project to provide inside information for financial, legal and commercial organisations taking part in the privatisation of British Rail, the Railway Gazette International newsletter saw circulation continuing to expand after the 1997 general election, and in 1998 the title was changed to Rail Business Intelligence to reflect its ongoing role in the UK's privatised rail market. It was published every second Thursday as a printed magazine and also in PDF electronic format. Alongside contributions from Editor Robert Preston and Founding Editor Roger Ford the main Contributing Editors were Chris Jackson Murray Hughes, Nick Kingsley, Richard Hope, Andrew Grantham and Tony Miles.text added by Tony Miles of RBI The newsletter was part of the Sutton, London based Railway Gazette Group, which includes publications such as Railway Gazette International, Metro Report International and RailwayGazette.com. ==See also== * Railroad-related periodicals ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:1995 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Biweekly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Business magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1995 Category:Magazines published in London Category:Professional and trade magazines Category:Rail transport magazines published in the United Kingdom fr:Railway Gazette International","['Rail transport', 'Sutton, London', 'United Kingdom', 'Railway Gazette Group', 'Railway Gazette International', 'Metro Report International', 'Railroad-related periodicals']","['Q3565868', 'Q3139238', 'Q145', 'Q7284161', 'Q119172', 'Q24088661', 'Q906202']","[[[1891, 1905]], [[1332, 1346]], [[223, 237], [1627, 1641], [1687, 1701], [1747, 1761], [1933, 1947]], [[341, 362], [1353, 1374]], [[728, 757], [1412, 1441], [1951, 1980]], [[1443, 1469]], [[1509, 1537]]]"
