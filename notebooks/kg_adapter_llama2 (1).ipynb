The novel fictionalizes the lives of the immigrants who played a large role in the building of the city of Toronto in the early 1900s, but whose contributions never became part of the city's official history.Devi, S.

Ondaatje spent many months in the archives of the City of Toronto and newspapers of the era.

In the Skin of a Lion, Michael Ondaatje explores the lives of Toronto's immigrant communities, focusing on the experiences of those who worked on the construction of the city's landmarks, the Prince Edward Viaduct, and the Bloor Street Viaduct. He also explores the themes of identity, culture, and belonging among the immigrants in Toronto, particularly those of Sri Lankan and South Asian descent. The novel is divided into three main sections: the lives of immigrants, the construction of Toronto, and the investment of the city. Each section is further divided into sub-sections, exploring the experiences of various immigrant groups in Toronto, including the Irish, the Italians, the Ukrainians, the Greeks, the Turks, the Indians, the Pakistanis, the Bangladeshis, the Sri Lankans, and the South Asians. The novel concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the themes explored in the novel, highlighting the importance of the experiences of immigrant life in Toronto, and how they have contributed to the construction of Canada's largest city.The novel is written in a poetic style, using imagery, symbolism, and figurative language to convey the themes and emotions of immigration, settlement, and belonging. The language is rich in metaphorical and allusional imagery, with a focus on the emotional and psychological aspects of immigration. The novel's structure is organized into a series of vignettes, each exploring a different aspect of immigration in Toronto. The vignettes are linked together through a common thread of imagery and symbolism, creating a rich and complex tapestry of themes, emotions, and experiences.The novel's conclusion is a reflection on the significance of the experiences explored, and the impact of immigration on the identity and belonging of the individuals and communities in Toronto.The conclusion is a call to action, encouraging the reader to engage with the themes, imagery, and symbolism of the novel, and to reflect on their own experiences of immigration and settlement, and to consider the importance of belonging in shaping their identities and communities. The conclusion is a invitation to explore the novel further, to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences and emotions explored in it, and to develop a more nuanced appreciation of immigration as a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.</s>\n",

      "The Lampyridae are a family of elateroid beetles with more than 2,000 described species, many of which are light-emitting. They are soft-bodied beetles commonly called fireflies, lightning bugs, or glowworms for their conspicuous production of light, mainly during twilight, to attract mates. Light production in the Lampyridae is thought to have originated as an honest warning signal that the larvae were distasteful; this was co-opted in evolution as a mating signal in the adults. In a further development, female fireflies of the genus Photuris mimic the flash pattern of Photinus species to trap their males as prey. Fireflies are found in temperate and tropical climates. Many live in marshes or in wet, wooded areas where their larvae have abundant sources of food. While all known fireflies glow as larvae, only some species produce light in their adult stage, and the location of the light organ varies among species and between sexes of the same species. Fireflies have attracted human attention since classical\n",

A few days after mating, a female lays her fertilized eggs on or just below the surface of the ground. The eggs hatch three to four weeks later. In certain firefly species with aquatic larvae, such as Aquatica leii, the female oviposits on emergent portions of aquatic plants, and the larvae descend into the water after hatching. The larvae feed until the end of the summer. Most fireflies hibernate as larvae. Some do this by burrowing underground, while others find places on or under the bark of trees. They emerge in the spring. At least one species, Ellychnia corrusca, overwinters as an adult. The larvae of most species are specialized predators and feed on ot\n",

The larvae of some species are important food sources for birds, fish, and other animals. Fireflies also play a role in nutrient cycling, as their larvae feed on decaying organic matter and help break it down into nutrients that can be used by other organisms. The adults of many species are important pollinators of flowers, particularly those in the family Solanaceae, including nightshade and bittersweet. ==Behavior== Adult fireflies are nocturnal, meaning they are active at night and rest during the day. They use their bioluminescence to locate mates, avoid predators, and navigate their surroundings. The flash patterns of fireflies have been studied extensively, and are thought to be a form of chemical communication used by the insects to signal their identity and reproductive status to other members of their species. The males of many species will fly in a zig-zag pattern while flashing their light, in an attempt to attract females. Once a male has attracted a female, the two will mate on the ground or in vegetation. The female will then lay her eggs on or just below the surface of the ground, where they will hatch into larvae after a few weeks. ==Conservation Status== Many firefly species are declining in numbers due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, as well as pesticide use and other environmental factors. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists several firefly species as endangered or vulnerable, and conservation efforts are underway to protect their habitats and reduce the impact of human activities on their populations. ==References== *[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/20173/Lampyridae] *[https://www.fs.fed.usda.gov/wildflower/wildlife/fireflies.shtml] *[www. entomology.msstate.edu/firefly/] *[books.google.com/books?id=JJJVBAAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v</s>\n",

      "In rock climbing, a nut (or chock or chockstone) is a metal wedge threaded on a wire that climbers use for protection by wedging it into a crack in the rock. Quickdraws are clipped to the nut wire by the ascending climber and the rope threads through the quickdraw. Nuts come in a variety of sizes and styles, and several different brands are made by competing manufacturers. Most nuts are made of aluminum. Larger nuts may be threaded on Dyneema cord instead of wire, but this has become unusual. The very smallest nuts are known as micronuts and may be made of brass or other metal, and typically have their wires soldered into them, instead of looped through drilled holes. They are mostly used in aid climbing, and their value as protection, arresting a climber's fall, is marginal because of both their low breaking strength and their tiny surface area (the HB 0 measures about 4 x 7 x 2.5 mm) in contact with the rock, though this can be offset if several are placed at a time.

British climbers in the 1950s and 1960s were the first to use nuts as climbing protection. In addition to using pitons, they picked up machine nuts from the side of railway tracks, climbed with them in their pockets, and used them as artificial chocks. This developed to the point where they drilled the thread from the middle, threaded them with slings, and used them in cracks. Nuts or chockstones are named after natural stones occasionally found wedged into cracks. Climbers eventually realized they could insert their own found pebble into a suitable crack. In an article called \"Artificial Aids in Mountaineering\" dated Oct-Dec 1956, G Sutton wrote about jammed knots for direct aid. He also compared the use of slings, chocks (rocks) and jammed knots to artificial climbing (aid climbing) and that \"there should be no illusion that the use of a chockstone is in any way more admira\n",

      "Gun-Marie Fredriksson (; 30 May 1958 – 9 December 2019) was a Swedish singer, best known internationally as the lead vocalist of pop rock duo Roxette, which she formed in 1986 with Per Gessle. The duo achieved international success in the late 1980s and early 1990s with their albums Look Sharp! (1988) and Joyride (1991), and had multiple hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including four number ones. Fredriksson had a successful career in her native country prior to forming Roxette. She was a member of punk group Strul, a band which created their own music festival in 1979. Strul's dissolution led to the creation of her next project, the short-lived MaMas Barn, after which she began releasing solo work. Her first album, Het vind, was issued in 1984, followed by Den sjunde vågen in 1986 and ... Efter stormen in 1987. Roxette's international breakthrough coincided with a period of inactivity for Fredriksson as a solo artist, punctuated only by the release of the non-album single \"Sparvöga\" in 1989. Subsequent solo albums included Den ständ\n",

During her rehabilitation, she continued to record music as a solo artist, resulting in The Change in 2004 and Min bäste vän in 2006, as well as the non-album single \"Där du andas\" in 2008—her first and only solo number one single in Sweden. She and Gessle later reunited to record more albums as Roxette, and the pair embarked on a worldwide concert tour. She also continued to record as a solo artist in her native Sweden, releasing Nu! in 2013. Fredriksson died on 9 December 2019 as a result of health issues stemming from her brain tumour. ==Early life== Gun-Marie Fredriksson was born on 30 May 1958 outside the small Swedish village of Össjö. She was the youngest of five children born of Charles Gösta Fredriksson (1914–1981) and Inez Dagmar Fredriksson (née Hoffert, 1922–1998).

The unincorporated community of Murat is located in the town. ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.7 square miles (92.5 km2), of which, 35.5 square miles (91.9 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.6 km2) of it (0.70%) is water. Geologists believe the last glacier to advance into this area stopped its advance at a line running through northern Hammel, just south of Lake Isadore, then retreated. See the map and discussion in the article on Taylor County. ==History== The six mile (10 km) square that would become Hammel was first surveyed in the summer of 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government.

      "In mathematics, an inequality is a relation which makes a non-equal comparison between two numbers or other mathematical expressions. It is used most often to compare two numbers on the number line by their size. There are several different notations used to represent different kinds of inequalities: * The notation a < b means that a is less than b. * The notation a > b means that a is greater than b. In either case, a is not equal to b. These relations are known as strict inequalities, meaning that a is strictly less than or strictly greater than b. Equality is excluded. In contrast to strict inequalities, there are two types of inequality relations that are not strict: * The notation a ≤ b or a ⩽ b means that a is less than or equal to b (or, equivalently, at most b, or not greater than b). * The notation a ≥ b or a ⩾ b means that a is greater than or equal to b (or, equivalently, at least b, or not less than b). The relation not greater than can also be represented by a ≯ b, the symbol for \"greater than\n",

      "\" bisected by a slash, \"not\". The same is true for not less than and a ≮ b. The notation a ≠ b means that a is not equal to b; this inequation sometimes is considered a form of strict inequality. It does not say that one is greater than the other; it does not even require a and b to be member of an ordered set. In engineering sciences, less formal use of the notation is to state that one quantity is \"much greater\" than another, normally by several orders of magnitude. * The notation a ≪ b means that a is much less than b. * The notation a ≫ b means that a is much greater than b. This implies that the lesser value can be neglected with little effect on the accuracy of an approximation (such as the case of ultrarelativistic limit in physics). In all of the cases above, any two symbols mirroring each other are symmetrical; a < b and b > a are equivalent, etc. == Properties on the number line == Inequalities are governed by the following properties.

      "Degaussing is the process of decreasing or eliminating a remnant magnetic field. It is named after the gauss, a unit of magnetism, which in turn was named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. Due to magnetic hysteresis, it is generally not possible to reduce a magnetic field completely to zero, so degaussing typically induces a very small \"known\" field referred to as bias. Degaussing was originally applied to reduce ships' magnetic signatures during World War II. Degaussing is also used to reduce magnetic fields in cathode ray tube monitors and to destroy data held on magnetic storage. ==Ships' hulls== thumb|right|USS Ronald Reagan prepares for deperming at Naval Station Norfolk Lambert's Point Deperming Station The term was first used by then-Commander Charles F. Goodeve, Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve, during World War II while trying to counter the German magnetic naval mines that were wreaking havoc on the British fleet. The mines detected the increase in the magnetic field when the steel in a ship\n",

      "concentrated the Earth's magnetic field over it. Admiralty scientists, including Goodeve, developed a number of systems to induce a small \"N-pole up\" field into the ship to offset this effect, meaning that the net field was the same as the background. Since the Germans used the gauss as the unit of the strength of the magnetic field in their mines' triggers (not yet a standard measure), Goodeve referred to the various processes to counter the mines as \"degaussing\". The term became a common word. The original method of degaussing was to install electromagnetic coils into the ships, known as coiling. In addition to being able to bias the ship continually, coiling also allowed the bias field to be reversed in the southern hemisphere, where the mines were set to detect \"S-pole down\" fields. British ships, notably cruisers and battleships, were well protected by about 1943. Installing such special equipment was, however, far too expensive and difficult to service all ships that would need it, so the navy developed an alt\n",

This method was less effective than coiling, but it was much cheaper and easier to install on a large number of ships. Degaussing is still used on some ships, such as aircraft carriers and submarines, to reduce their magnetic signatures. ==Cathode ray tube monitors== thumb|right|A CRT monitor with degaussing coils visible on the back In the 1970s and 1980s, CRT monitors used magnetic fields to control the orientation of the electron beam inside the tube. The magnetic field was created by a set of coils around the tube, which were powered by a degaussing transformer. Over time, the magnetic field could become distorted or demagnetized, causing problems with the display. To fix this problem, the monitor would need to be degaussed, which involved applying a strong magnetic field to the coils to re-magnetize them. This process was typically done by connecting the monitor to a special degaussing unit, which would generate a strong magnetic pulse that would magnetize the coils again. ==Data destruction== thumb|left|A degaussing wand used to erase data from magnetic media In addition to reducing magnetic fields, degaussing can also be used to destroy data stored on magnetic media, such as hard drives, tape drives, and floppy disks. This is done by applying a strong magnetizing field to the media, which causes the magnetic domains in the media to become randomly aligned, effectively destroying the data. This method is often used to securely dispose of old or sensitive data, as it is difficult to recover data that has been degaussed. ==See also== * [[Magnetic field]] * [[Electromagnetic induction]] * [[Gauss]] * [[Hysteresis (magnetic materials)]] ==References== * Goodeve, C.

      "Deerhurst is a village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, about southwest of Tewkesbury. The village is on the east bank of the River Severn. The parish includes the village of Apperley and the hamlet of Deerhurst Walton. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 906, the majority of whom live in Apperley. The place-name is derived from Old English and means \"deer-wood\". It was spelt Deorhyrst in AD 804, Dorhirst in about 1050 and Derherste in the Domesday Book in 1086. ==Geography== The parish has an area of about , bounded by the Severn to the west, the A38 road to the east and Coombe Hill Canal to the south. The parish is low-lying and much of it is repeatedly flooded. After serious flooding in 1947 several cottages were abandoned and demolished. Deerhurst was inundated again by the floods of 2007. ==Priory and parish church== By AD 804 there was a Benedictine monastery at Deerhurst, which also held the manor. In about 1060 King Edward the Confessor divided the manor. He granted the monastery, with one hide of land\n",

Deerhurst Priory ceased to be an alien house in 1443 and the Crown granted it to Tewkesbury Abbey in 1467. Both the abbey and the priory were dissolved in 1540. The priory church of St Mary, built in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries AD, survives as Deerhurst's Church of England parish church.

His music career spans more than 50 years. == Career == === The Dominettes === Steve Gibbons started his professional life as a plumber's apprentice in Harborne. He joined the Dominettes in 1958, to replace Colin Smith, who had left to join Jimmy Powell's backing group. Colin Smith later changed his name to Carl Barron and became the singer with The Cheetahs. An Elvis Presley fan, Gibbons' first performance with The Dominettes was at The California public house near Weoley Castle. Regular music venues for The Dominettes in the early 1960s were the Grotto Club on Bromsgrove Street, and The Sicilia Coffee Bar in Edgbaston. The group by this time included many R&B; numbers into their set and this style of music suited Gibbons' gritty vocals.

Setoids are studied especially in proof theory and in type- theoretic foundations of mathematics. Often in mathematics, when one defines an equivalence relation on a set, one immediately forms the quotient set (turning equivalence into equality). In contrast, setoids may be used when a difference between identity and equivalence must be maintained, often with an interpretation of intensional equality (the equality on the original set) and extensional equality (the equivalence relation, or the equality on the quotient set). ==Proof theory== In proof theory, particularly the proof theory\n",

      "of constructive mathematics based on the Curry–Howard correspondence, one often identifies a mathematical proposition with its set of proofs (if any). A given proposition may have many proofs, of course; according to the principle of proof irrelevance, normally only the truth of the proposition matters, not which proof was used. However, the Curry–Howard correspondence can turn proofs into algorithms, and differences between algorithms are often important. So proof theorists may prefer to identify a proposition with a setoid of proofs, considering proofs equivalent if they can be converted into one another through beta conversion or the like. ==Type theory== In type-theoretic foundations of mathematics, setoids may be used in a type theory that lacks quotient types to model general mathematical sets. For example, in Per Martin- Löf's intuitionistic type theory, there is no type of real numbers, only a type of regular Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. To do real analysis in Martin-Löf's framework, therefore, one must work with a setoid of real numbers, the\n",

Harold Wood was part of the ancient parish of Hornchurch, which became the Liberty of Havering. Most of the current area of Harold Wood became part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1926. It is near to the Greater London boundary with Essex. ==History== ===Toponymy=== The name Harold Wood was recorded in about 1237, when it was shown as Horalds Wood. It was named after King Harold Godwinson, who was defeated by William the Conqueror in 1066. He held the surrounding manor of Havering-atte-Bower. Some of the original roads are named after Anglo-Saxon kings such as Æthelstan and Alfred the Great. ===Local government=== Harold Wood formed a ward in the ancient parish of Hornchurch, although the area now around the station was in the North End ward.

Harold Wood ward came under the control of the vestry of Romford chapelry, which also included Collier Row and Noak Hill, however most of the current area of Harold Wood was in the North End ward which remained under Hornchurch parish vestry. In 1836 Romford and Hornchurch became separate civil parishes and were grouped into the Romford Poor Law Union.

In 1917 he graduated with an Engineer's degree in chemical engineering from the Delft Institute of Technology. While working in Delft for four years, the last two as a high school teacher, he wrote a highly theoretical and mathematical paper on relative motion which he sent to William Francis Gray Swann. Swann, then offered him to earn a Ph.D. degree in theoretical physics with him at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis, which he did in two years time by expanding on his paper (dissertation: A Study of Relative Motion in Connection with Classical Mechanics, 1923). After another year with Swann, now in Chicago, and a year at various labs in the Netherlands and Germany and two months at Niels Bohr's lab in Copenhagen, he became a postdoc at Caltech.

      "A de Dion tube is a form of non-independent automobile suspension. It is a considerable improvement over the swing axle, Hotchkiss drive, or live axle.Setright, L. J.

Because it plays no part in transmitting power to the drive wheels, it is sometimes called a \"dead axle\".Setright, p.515. A powered de Dion suspension uses universal joints on its driveshafts at both the wheel hubs and differential, and a solid tubular beam to hold the opposite wheels in parallel. Unlike an anti-roll bar, a de Dion tube is not directly connected to the chassis nor is it intended to flex. In suspension geometry it is a beam axle suspension. ==History== The de Dion tube was named after Comte Jules- Albert de Dion, founder of French automobile manufacturer De Dion-Bouton.

Fixing the camber of both wheels at 0° assists in obtaining good traction from wide tires and also tends to reduce wheel hop under high power operations compared to an independent suspension. #The choice of shock absorbers and springs is made easier. #The two wheels may be individually aligned, allowing for independent camber (vertical) and track (horizontal) alignment. Disadvantages: #A pair of CV or universal joints is required for each wheel, adding complexity, cost, and weight. #If coil springs are used, then a lateral location link (usually either a Panhard rod or Watt's linkage) is required, plus additional torque links on each side (five link suspension) or a combination of lower traili\n",

It is frequently associated with incorporation into the Christian Church, the bestowal of spiritual gifts, and empowerment for Christian ministry. Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection that empowers a person for Christian life and service. The term baptism with the Holy Spirit originates in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions accept it as a theological concept.

      "Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science. While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. The early era of space exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. A driving force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War.

Many early television networks such as the BBC, CBS, NBC or ABC in the USA and in Australia evolved from earlier radio networks. ==Overview== In countries where most networks broadcast identical, centrally originated content to all of their stations and where most individual television transmitters therefore operate only as large \"repeater stations\", the terms \"television network\", \"television channel\" (a numeric identifier or radio frequency) and \"television station\" have become mostly interchangeable in everyday language, with professionals in television-\n",

Debating the question is considered a good way to start an argument in the area, since there is no clear or contemporaneously recorded answer, with many authoritatively and insistently stated, albeit significantly different explanations since the 19th century, with at least some tenuous justification to each. An aspect of the name theories is that Harold’s Cross lies on the ancient Slíghe Chualann, a major South to North route and one of the ‘Five Great Roads’ of medieval Ireland and a key southern entry point into Dublin City via Clanbrassil Street.

      "A costermonger, coster, or costard is a street seller of fruit and vegetables in British towns. The term is derived from the words costard (a medieval variety of apple) and monger (seller), and later came to be used to describe hawkers in general.Roberts, Chris, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme. Thorndike Press 2006. () Some historians have pointed out that a hierarchy existed within the costermonger class and that while costermongers sold from a handcart or animal-drawn cart, mere hawkers carried their wares in a basket. Costermongers met a need for rapid food distribution from the wholesale markets (e.g., in London: Smithfield for meat, Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or Billingsgate for fish) by providing retail sales at locations that were convenient for the labouring classes. Costermongers used a variety of devices to transport and display produce: a cart might be stationary at a market stall; a mobile (\n",

      "horse-drawn or wheelbarrow) apparatus or a hand-held basket might be used for light-weight goods such as herbs and flowers. Costermongers experienced a turbulent history, yet survived numerous attempts to eradicate their class from the streets. Programmes designed to curtail their activities occurred during the reigns of Elizabeth I, Charles I and reached a peak during Victorian times. However, the social cohesion within the coster community, along with sympathetic public support, enabled them to resist efforts to eradicate them. They became known for their melodic sales patter, poems and chants, which they used to attract attention. Both the sound and appearance of costermongers contributed to a distinctive street life that characterised London and other large European cities, including Paris, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries. Their loud sing-song cry or chants used to attract attention became part of the fabric of street life in large cities in Britain and Europe. Costermongers exhibited a distinct identity. Individuals signalled membership of the coster community through a\n",

Costermongers were also known for their distinctive accent, which was a blend of Cockney and other regional dialects. The term costermonger has been used as a metaphor to describe someone who sells or promotes something aggressively or persistently, often in a way that is perceived as annoying or intrusive. The term has also been used to describe a person who engages in street vending or hawking in a persistent or aggressive manner, often in violation of local laws or regulations. In the 19th century, the term was used to describe street vendors in New York City, particularly those who sold fruits and vegetables from pushcarts. In the early 20th century, costermongers in the United States were often immigrants from Eastern Europe, particularly Jews from Poland and Russia, who sold goods on the streets of large cities such as New York and Chicago. In the United States, the term coster is sometimes used as a synonym for a street vendor, particularly one who sells food or drinks from a pushcart or other portable stand. The term is also used in other English-speaking countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, where street vending is a common practice. In some cases, the term has been used in a derogatory or pejorative manner to describe someone perceived as aggressive or pushy in their sales tactics, particularly in the context of door-to-door sales or other forms of direct marketing. In popular culture, the term is often used in a nostalgic or romanticised manner to describe a bygone era of street vending, particularly in cities such as London and New York, where the tradition of costermongering has been an important part of the urban landscape for centuries. The term may also be used in a humorous or ironic manner, particularly in reference to modern-day street vendors or hawkers, who may be perceived as less authentic or less skilled than their predecessors.

He was selected by the Denver Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA draft and was immediately traded to the San Antonio Spurs. His longest and most successful NBA tenure was with the Houston Rockets. The nickname \"Mad Max\" was bestowed upon Maxwell by color commentators for his clutch three-point shooting, which reached its pinnacle in the deciding game of the 1994 NBA Finals between Houston and New York. Maxwell is among just nine players in NBA history to amass 30 points in a single quarter, accomplishing that feat en route to a 51-point outing on January 26, 1991, against Cleveland. ==Early years== Maxwell was born in Gainesville, Florida.

Netscape assigned its browser development engineers to help with the project.

      "MTU Aero Engines AG is a German aircraft engine manufacturer. MTU develops, manufactures and provides service support for military and civil aircraft engines. MTU Aero Engines was formerly known as MTU München. ==History== While the Munich-based engine manufacturer Rapp Motorenwerke, and subsequently BMW, had produced aircraft engines since 1913, the modern company regards the formal date of its formation as being 1934, the year in which BMW Flugmotorenbau GmbH was spun-off from BMW. This step was initiated by the Ministry of Aviation in order to disguise the planned rearmament of the Luftwaffe – as a standalone limited company the Flugmotorenbau GmbH had less strict disclosure requirements. Additionally, BMW aimed at outsourcing the unforeseeable risk of contributing to the German rearmament. In 1936, BMW built an aircraft engine plant in Allach near Munich, which are the headquarters of MTU Aero Engines today. In 1940, the plant was expanded significantly to start large-scale production of BMW 801 aircraft engines, which powered the Focke-\n",

Following the conclusion of the conflict in May 1945, American troops occupied the factory grounds in Allach, after which aircraft engine production was halted for ten years. During these years, the factory served as a U.S. Army vehicle and artillery repair shop. ===1950s=== On 22 January 1954, BMW formally re-commenced aircraft engine development. Three years later, after the ban on engine production was lifted in Germany, the company was able to restart aero engine production at Allach, initially focusing upon the licensed production of foreign-sourced, typically American, aero engines. By 1959, BMW Triebwerkbau GmbH was engaged in the production under licence of the General Electric J79-11A turbojet engine for the German Air Force's Lockheed F-104 Starfighter fleet. ===1960s=== During the 1960s, the Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engine was also being manufactured via a licensing arrangement, it was used as the p\n",

He was the first New York-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. He was a popular horse and remained a fan favorite in retirement at the Kentucky Horse Park. ==Background== Funny Cide was bred at WinStar Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, but was foaled at the McMahon of Saratoga Thoroughbred Farm, owned by Joe and Anne McMahon in Saratoga Springs, New York. His sire is Distorted Humor, who was then an unproven sire at WinStar, struggling to attract good mares. Belle's Good Cide, an Oklahoma-bred granddaughter of Seattle Slew, was already at the farm, and was therefore bred to him. She was then shipped to New York so her foal would be eligible for New York-bred races. Funny Cide was part of Distorted Humor's first American crop when his stud fee was $12,500, dropping down the next year to $10,000.

Funny Cide was consigned to the August 2001 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga-preferred yearling auction, where he was inspected by Tony Everard, a \"pinhooker\" looking for young, undeveloped horses to train and resell in a few months at a profit. Everard liked what he saw, even though the colt was a ridgling with one undescended testicle, and purchased the colt for $22,000. Everard then took the colt to his New Episode Training Center in Ocala, Florida, and made the decision to geld the colt. \"With ridglings, it's better to go ahead and geld them early,\" he would later say. \"My experience is once they start training around turns they are moving faster and getting pinched and it hurts them.\" ===Barclay Tagg=== Barclay Tagg purchased the gelding for $75,000 in a private transaction in March, 2002 for Sackatoga Stable.

      "Foundation and Chaos (1998) is a science fiction novel by Greg Bear, set in Isaac Asimov's Foundation universe. It is the second book of the Second Foundation trilogy, which was written after Asimov's death by three authors, authorized by the Asimov estate. ==Plot summary== The novel is the second part of the Second Foundation Trilogy and takes place almost entirely in the same time frame as \"The Psychohistorians\", which is the first part of the novel Foundation. In addition to telling a more expanded version of Hari Seldon's confrontation with the Commission of Public Safety it also interweaves R. Daneel Olivaw's struggle against a sect of robots who oppose his plans for humanity. While covering the same period as in Asimov’s \"The Psychohistorians\", Foundation and Chaos focuses more on paternal super-robot R. Daneel Olivaw than on Hari Seldon. Olivaw’s 20 millennia of machinations and contrivances are questioned by “Calvinian” robots who do not observe Olivaw’s Zeroth Law (“No robot may\n",

      " last part \n",

      "harm humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm”) developed in Asimov’s Robots and Empire. Olivaw’s actions dampen human intellectual growth and variation until the human species matures. The novel’s primary issue is whether Olivaw’s ends justify his means. Does the ancient Auroran robot really serve humanity’s greater good? Should Olivaw decide this for himself? Seldon seems unaware of Olivaw’s role in perpetuating brain fever and other dampeners. But Seldon would probably approve, considering his quarantining of the New Renaissance worlds when Seldon served as Imperial 1st Minister. Foundation and Chaos portrays the rise of mentalics (telepaths who can influence other’s thoughts) such as Wanda Seldon and Stettin Palver, who will form the Second Foundation. Twisted rogue mentalic Vara Liso even foreshadows the mutant Magnifico’s spectacular rise 310 years later.

The novel's exploration of the nature of free will and the role of robots in society was particularly praised, with many reviewers noting that it added a new layer of depth to the series.

His landscapes were mostly of coastal scenes, with a low horizon and large sky, showing a brilliant handling of light and atmosphere. He also painted small historical cabinet paintings in a freely-handled version of the troubadour style. ==Life and work== Richard Parkes Bonington was born in the town of Arnold, four miles from Nottingham.\"Arnold\" in Chambers's Encyclopædia.

At this time, Bonington started taking lessons from the painter François Louis Thomas Francia,Ingamells, 19 who, having recently returned from England, where he had been deeply influenced by the work of Thomas Girtin,Binyon, pp. 166–7 taught him the English watercolour technique. In 1818, the Bonington family moved to Paris to open a lace shop. There he met and became friends with Eugène Delacroix. He worked for a time producing copies of Dutch and Flemish landscapes in the Louvre. In 1820, he started attending the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied under Antoine- Jean, Baron Gros. It was around this time that Bonington started going on sketching tours in the suburbs of Paris and the surrounding countryside. His first paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1822. He also began to work in oils \n",

Bonington died of tuberculosis at the age of 25, in Paris, France. ==Influence== Bonington was one of the most influential British artists of his time, and his work had a significant impact on the development of Romanticism in both Britain and France. His landscapes, characterized by their low horizons and large skies, were inspired by the works of the old masters, yet were entirely modern in their application. His use of light and atmosphere was particularly innovative, and his ability to capture the mood and atmosphere of a scene was unmatched by any of his contemporaries. Bonington's influence can be seen in the work of artists such as John Constable and J.M.W. Turner, who were both inspired by his landscapes and technique.

Bonington died of tuberculosis at the age of 25, in Paris, France. ==Influence== Bonington was one of the most influential British artists of his time, and his work had a significant impact on the development of Romanticism in both Britain and France. His landscapes, characterized by their low horizons and large skies, were inspired by the works of the old masters, yet were entirely modern in their application. His use of light and atmosphere was particularly innovative, and his ability to capture the mood and atmosphere of a scene was unmatched by any of his contemporaries. Bonington's influence can be seen in the work of artists such as John Constable and J.M.W. Turner, who were both inspired by his landscapes and technique. Bonington was also an important influence on the French Romantic movement, particularly on artists such as Eugène Delacroix and Théodore Rousseau, who were drawn to his use of bold, vibrant colours and his emphasis on capturing the emotional and atmospheric qualities of a scene. ==References== Ingamells, John (1997).

      "George Boole Jnr (; 2 November 1815 – 8 December 1864) was a largely self- taught English mathematician, philosopher, and logician, most of whose short career was spent as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland. He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of The Laws of Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the Information Age, alongside the work of Claude Shannon. Boole was the son of a shoemaker. He received a primary school education and learned Latin and modern languages through various means. At 16, he began teaching to support his family.

In 1864, Boole died due to fever-induced pleural effusion after developing pneumonia. Boole published around 50 articles and several separate publications in his lifetime. Some of his key works include a paper on early invariant theory and \"The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,\" which introduced symbolic logic. Boole also wrote two systematic treatises: \"Treatise on Differential Equations\" and \"Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences.\" He contributed to the theory of linear differential equations and the study of the sum of residues of a rational function. In 1847, Boole developed Boolean algebra, a fundamental concept in binary logic, which laid the groundwork for the algebra of logic tradition and forms the foundation of digital circuit design and modern computer science.

In the United Kingdom, paediatrics covers many of their youth until the age of 18. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends people seek pediatric care through the age of 21, but some pediatric subspecialists continue to care for adults up to 25. Worldwide age limits of pediatrics have been trending upward year after year. A medical doctor who specializes in this area is known as a pediatrician, or paediatrician. The word pediatrics and its cognates mean \"healer of children\", derived from the two Greek words: (pais \"child\") and (iatros \"doctor, healer\").

He was the son of a landowner and was raised at his father's estate at Bönkein which was near Königsberg. He entered the University of Königsberg when he was 15, but later moved to the University of Berlin where he studied with Gustav Dirichlet. Despite having his studies delayed by illness, in 1853 Lipschitz graduated with a PhD in Berlin. After receiving his PhD, Lipschitz started teaching at local Gymnasiums. In 1857 he married Ida Pascha, the daughter of one of the landowners with an estate near to his father's, and earned his habilitation at the University of Bonn, where he remained as a privatdozent.

Up to 1950, people mentioned \"Clifford–Lipschitz numbers\" when they referred to this discovery of Lipschitz. Yet Lipschitz's name suddenly disappeared from the publications involving Clifford algebras; for instance Claude Chevalley (1909–1984) gave the name \"Clifford group\" to an object that is never mentioned in Clifford's works, but stems from Lipschitz's.

The pan-blue coalition strongly argued that having a majority pan-green legislature would lead to a \"super-president\" while the pan-green coalition stated that a majority pan-green legislature was necessary to prevent deadlock and chaos and to finally eliminate the vestiges of the KMT's previous authoritarian government on Taiwan. A major issue of the election was whether to amend or replace the Constitution of the Republic of China. In his second inaugural address in May 2004, President Chen Shui-bian proposed to hold a referendum in 2006 on an entirely new constitution to be adopted in 2008. The Pan-Green Coalition argued that the current constitution, drafted by the Kuomintang in mainland China in 1947, is outdated and unfit for Taiwan as it was originally designed for all of China.

The Pan-Blue Coalition, on the other hand, argued that the Constitution of the Republic of China is still valid, and that any changes to it should be made through the amendment process outlined in the Constitution, rather than through a new constitution drafted by the pan-green coalition. The pan-blue coalition also argued that any new constitution should be put to a national referendum, rather than a referendum limited to a specific date, such as 2008. The Pan Blue Coalition also campaigned on a platform of reducing corruption, improving the economy, and maintaining good relations with mainland China. The Pan Green Coalition campaigned on issues such as human rights, environmental protection, and the rights of indigenous peoples. ==Election results== The election resulted in a landslide victory for the Pan-Blue coalition, with the KMT winning 81 seats, the People First Party winning 13 seats, and the New Party winning 2 seats. The Pan Greens lost 34 seats, with the DPP losing 24 seats and the Taiwan Solidarity Union losing 10 seats. The KMT's victory was seen as a rejection of President Chen Shui-bian's policies and a referendum on his presidency. However, the KMT did not win a majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan, and the DPP remained the largest party in the legislature. ==Aftermath== The election results were seen as a major setback for the Pan Green coalition, which had been in power since the 1996 legislative election. The election also marked the beginning of a period of political polarization and gridlock in Taiwanese politics, as the KMT and DPP became increasingly entrenched in their positions and were unable to work together to pass legislation. In the aftermath of the election, there were several high-profile defections from the DPP to the KMT, including the defection of several high-ranking officials and the resignation of several DPP legislators. The election was also marked by allegations of electoral fraud and irregularities, particularly in the DPP stronghold of Kaohsiung, where there were reports of wides</s>\n",

The Pan Blue Coalition also campaigned on a platform of reducing corruption, improving the economy, and maintaining good relations with mainland China. The Pan Green Coalition campaigned on issues such as human rights, environmental protection, and the rights of indigenous peoples. ==Election results== The election resulted in a landslide victory for the Pan-Blue coalition, with the KMT winning 81 seats, the People First Party winning 13 seats, and the New Party winning 2 seats. The Pan Greens lost 34 seats, with the DPP losing 24 seats and the Taiwan Solidarity Union losing 10 seats. The KMT's victory was seen as a rejection of President Chen Shui-bian's policies and a referendum on his presidency. However, the KMT did not win a majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan, and the DPP remained the largest party in the legislature. ==Aftermath== The election results were seen as a major setback for the Pan Green coalition, which had been in power since the 1996 legislative election. The election also marked the beginning of a period of political polarization and gridlock in Taiwanese politics, as the KMT and DPP became increasingly entrenched in their positions and were unable to work together to pass legislation. In the aftermath of the election, there were several high-profile defections from the DPP to the KMT, including the defection of several high-ranking officials and the resignation of several DPP legislators. The election was also marked by allegations of electoral fraud and irregularities, particularly in the DPP stronghold of Kaohsiung, where there were reports of wides</s>\n",

The book was on the New York Times bestseller list for 49 weeks.

      "Science fantasy is a hybrid genre within speculative fiction that simultaneously draws upon or combines tropes and elements from both science fiction and fantasy. In a conventional science fiction story, the world is presented as being scientifically logical, while a conventional fantasy story contains mostly supernatural and artistic elements that disregard the scientific laws of the real world. The world of science fantasy, however, is laid out to be scientifically logical and often supplied with hard science- like explanations of any supernatural elements.Eric R. Williams, The Screenwriters Taxonomy: A Collaborative Approach to Creative Storytelling, p. 121 During the Golden Age of Science Fiction, the fanciful science fantasy stories were seen in sharp contrast to the terse, scientifically plausible material that came to dominate mainstream science fiction, typified by the magazine Astounding Science Fiction.

      "romance proved to be an early major influence on the \"New Wave\" writers of the 1960s, who became exasperated by the limitations of \"hard\" SF. Distinguishing between pure science fiction and pure fantasy, Rod Serling argued that the former was \"the improbable made possible\" while the latter was \"the impossible made probable\". As a combination of the two, science fantasy gives a scientific veneer of realism to things that simply could not happen in the real world under any circumstances. Where science fiction does not permit the existence of fantastical or supernatural elements, science fantasy explicitly relies upon them to complement the scientific elements. In explaining the intrigue of science fantasy, Carl D. Malmgren provides an intro regarding C. S. Lewis's speculation on the emotional needs at work in the subgenre: \"In the counternatural worlds of science fantasy, the imaginary and the actual, the magical and the prosaic, the mythical and the scientific, me\n",

Science fantasy is often used to explore the relationship between science and the supernatural, as well as the consequences of scientific progress and technological advancements on society and the environment. It can also be used to explore philosophical and ethical questions, such as the nature of consciousness, the morality of artificial intelligence, and the ethics of scientific experimentation. Science fiction and fantasy elements can be used to create a sense of wonder, awe, and mystery in the reader, while the scientific explanations provide a sense of grounding and realism to the story. The genre has been used to explore a wide range of themes, including space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, artificial intelligence, cyborgs, alien life, and the end of the world. Some notable examples of science fantasy include J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, Frank Herbert's Dune, Ursula K. Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness, and Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Science fantasy has also been used as a tool for social commentary, as seen in George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, which use dystopian futures to comment on the dangers of totalitarianism and the dehumanizing effects of advanced technology, respectively. In addition to its use in literature, science fantasy has been used in film, television, and video games to create immersive and imaginative worlds that challenge the viewer's perceptions of reality and the limits of scientific possibility.

A science fiction series and political satire, it was set in the U.S., particularly Chicago, Illinois, in the early 2030s. Writers besides Chaykin included Steven Grant, J.M.

Regardless, writer-artist Howard Chaykin, then living in New York City, felt trepidation when First Comics approached him to do a project.

The first 12 issues, running through cover-date September 1984, consisted of four interlocking, three-issue story arcs. Chaykin recalled his difficulty in producing 28 pages of art and script monthly: \"I was still a smoker and a drinker at the time. And [the output was such that] I'd never done anything like that before, and it was insane. It just devoured my life [and] I had no assistants. I didn't know how to work with an assistant at that point, and it was a very difficult process. ... I was trying to do a fairly high-quality product and I didn't want to slough it off\".

Chaykin's work on American Flagg! was well-received by critics, who praised the series for its unique blend of science fiction and political satire, as well as its innovative artwork. The series was also notable for its use of real-world political and social issues, such as the Iran-Contra affair, the AIDS epidemic, and the Reagan administration. In 1985, American Flagg was nominated for the Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series, and Chaykin was nominated for Best Writer/Artist. In 2010, the series was re-released in digital format by Comixology, and in 2020, it was collected in a hardcover omnibus edition by Dark Horse Comics. ==Critical reception== American Flagg has been well received by critics, with praise for its blend of political satire and science fiction themes. The series has been described as a \"satirical masterpiece\" and \"one of the best comics of the '80s\". The series has also been praised for its unique artwork, with one critic noting that \"Chaykin’s artwork is some of the most distinctive and memorable of the era\". The series' blend of satire and social commentary has been praised as well, with one reviewer noting that the series is \"a scathing critique of the political and social climate of the early '80's\". ==Characters== The main character of American Flagg is Reuben Flagg, a former TV star who is drafted into the Plexus Rangers and posted as a deputy in Chicago, Illinois. Flagg is a cynical and sarcastic character who often finds himself at odds with the corrupt and incompetent government officials who run the Plex. Other notable characters in the series include: *Misty Knight: A tough-as-nails detective who works with Flagg to solve crimes in Chicago. *Slam Bradley: A former child star who is now a drug addict and is often seen as a foil to Flagg's cynicism. *The President: The leader of the United States, who is often portrayed as a bumbling and ineffective figure. *The Plex: The all-encompassing corporation that governs the United States after it has been relocated to Mars. *The Rangers: A paramilitary organization that is tasked with maintaining order in the United States. ==Themes</s>\n",

It is popularly used by artists as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden frame. Modern canvas is usually made of cotton or linen, or sometimes polyvinyl chloride (PVC), although historically it was made from hemp. It differs from other heavy cotton fabrics, such as denim, in being plain weave rather than twill weave. Canvas comes in two basic types: plain and duck. The threads in duck canvas are more tightly woven. The term duck comes from the Dutch word for cloth, doek. In the United States, canvas is classified in two ways: by\n",

Both may be derivatives of the Vulgar Latin cannapaceus for \"made of hemp\", originating from the Greek (cannabis). ==For painting== Canvas has become the most common support medium for oil painting, replacing wooden panels. It was used from the 14th century in Italy, but only rarely. One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French Madonna with angels from around 1410 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. Its use in Saint George and the Dragon by Paolo Uccello in about 1470,Gordon, xiii and Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus in the 1480s was still unusual for the period.

In the early 17th century, it became the most common support for oil painting, especially for large paintings. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, canvas was used as a support for paintings by the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, such as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, and Vincent van Gogh.

Canvas can also be stretched over a wooden frame, called a stretcher, to create a taut, even surface for painting. Canvas is a popular choice for painting because it is durable, versatile, and easy to work with. It can be used to create a wide range of styles and effects, from realistic to abstract, and it can be stretched or distorted to create interesting textures and shapes. In addition, canvas is relatively inexpensive and easy to transport, making it a practical choice for artists who work on location or who need to transport their work to exhibitions. ==For other uses== Canvas has been used for many other purposes throughout history, including: *As a building material for tents, awnings, and other structures. *As a material for clothing, such as backpacks, shelters, and other outdoor gear. *As an upholstery material for furniture, such as handbags, electronic device cases, and shoes. *In the manufacture of sails for ships and boats. *In art, as a support medium for paintings, drawings, and prints. *In photography, as a material for printing and mounting photographs. *In textiles, as a base material for woven or knitted fabrics. *In construction, as a reinforcing material for concrete and other building materials. *In agriculture, as a covering for greenhouses. *In geotechnical engineering, as a liner for tunnels and other underground structures. *In waterproofing, as a barrier against water and moisture. *In aerospace, as a lightweight, high-strength material for aircraft and spacecraft. *In medicine, as a wound</s>\n",

Geiger observed the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll and instantly recognized that atomic bombs could render amphibious landings difficult because of the dense concentrations of troops, ships, and material at the beachhead. The Commandant of the Marine Corps convened a special board, the Hogaboom Board, that recommended that the Marine Corps develop transport helicopters in order to allow a more diffuse attack on enemy shores. It also recommended that they stand up an experimental helicopter squadron. HMX-1 was commissioned on December 1, 1947 under the command of Colonel Edward C. Dyer and based at MCAS Quantico, Virginia, because of its relative proximity to the Sikorsky and Piasecki plants in Connecticut, and to the Marine Corps schools where most of the original personnel would come.

He began classical piano studies at the age of 4, and became interested in pop music and started his own band in 6th grade. His dual-track musical interests led him to jazz-rock fusion and included a professional performance in his later high school years with the Pittsburgh alto sax player Eric Kloss. His choice of music school was fortuitous as the New England Conservatory of Music had as its president in the 1970s the composer/historian Gunther Schuller.

      "Zino's petrel (Pterodroma madeira) or the freira, is a species of small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus, endemic to the island of Madeira. This long-winged petrel has a grey back and wings, with a dark \"W\" marking across the wings, and a grey upper tail. The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a triangle of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. It is very similar in appearance to the slightly larger Fea's petrel, and separating these two Macaronesian species at sea is very challenging. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the soft- plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but they are not closely related, and Zino's was raised to the status of a species because of differences in morphology, calls, breeding behaviour and mitochondrial DNA. It is Europe's most endangered seabird, with breeding areas restricted to a few ledges high in the central mountains of Madeira.

This period of cricket in the United States was dominated by \"gentlemen cricketers\"—men of independent wealth who did not need to work.

      "The Ruhr ( ; , also Ruhrpott ), also referred to as the Ruhr area, sometimes Ruhr district, Ruhr region, or Ruhr valley, is a polycentric urban area in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. With a population density of 2,800/km2 and a population of over 5 million (2017), it is the largest urban area in Germany. It consists of several large cities bordered by the rivers Ruhr to the south, Rhine to the west, and Lippe to the north. In the southwest it borders the Bergisches Land. It is considered part of the larger Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region of more than 10 million people, which is the third largest in Western Europe, behind only London and Paris. The Ruhr cities are, from west to east: Duisburg, Oberhausen, Bottrop, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Essen, Gelsenkirchen, Bochum, Herne, Hagen, Dortmund, Hamm and the districts of Wesel, Recklinghausen, Unna and Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis.

      "), Essen (about 583,000) and Duisburg (about 497,000). In the Middle Ages, the Hellweg was an important trade route from the region of the Lower Rhine to the mountains of the Teutoburg Forest. The most important towns of the region from Duisburg to the imperial city of Dortmund were concentrated along the Hellweg from the Rhineland to Westphalia. Since the 19th century, these cities have grown together into a large complex with a vast industrial landscape, inhabited by some 7.3 million people (including Düsseldorf and Wuppertal, large cities that are nearby but officially not part of the Ruhr area). The Ruhr area has no administrative centre; each city in the area has its own administration, although there is a supracommunal institution in Essen. For 2010, the Ruhr region was one of the European Capitals of Culture. == Etymology == The 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica has only one definition of \"Ruhr\": \"a river of Germany, an important right-bank tributary of the lower Rhine\". The use of the term \"Ruhr\" for the industrial region started in Britain only after World War\n",

In 1815, the Congress of Vienna created the Kingdom of Prussia, which included the Ruhr region. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area became a major industrial center, with the construction of railways, canals, and other infrastructure. In the First World War, the Ruhr was a major battleground. In the Second World War, it was heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. After the war, the Allies divided Germany into four occupation zones, and the Ruhr became part of the British zone. In the course of the economic miracle of the post-war period, the region became one of the most important industrial areas in Europe. == Economy == The economy of the Ruhr is based on mining, metallurgy, and heavy industry. The region is home to several major companies, including ThyssenKrupp, E.ON, and RWE. The Ruhr region is also home to several universities and research institutions, including the University of Duisburg-Essen, the University of Bochum, and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. == Culture == The cultural landscape of the Ruhrarea is shaped by its industrial history. Many of the cities in the region have a rich cultural heritage, including museums, theaters, and concert halls. The region also has a vibrant arts scene, with numerous galleries and festivals throughout the year. In 2010, the European Union designated the Ruhr as one of the European Capitals of Culture, highlighting its cultural diversity and richness. == Transportation == The region is served by several major airports, including the Düsseldorf Airport, the Essen/Duisburg Airport, and the Dortmund Airport.

There are currently four broadcasts per day at the following (UK local) times: 00:48, 05:20, 12:01, and 17:54. In the forecast, the waters around the British Isles are divided into 31 sea areas, also known as weather areas. The forecast begins by listing areas with gale warnings, followed by a general synopsis of pressure areas, then a forecast for each individual sea area covering wind speed and direction, precipitation, and visibility. Extended forecasts at 00:48 and 05:20 include information from coastal weather stations and inshore waters.

In response to this loss, FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications.

In 1911, the Met Office began issuing marine weather forecasts which included gale and storm warnings via radio transmission for areas around Great Britain. This service was discontinued during and following the First World War, between 1914 and June 1921, and again during the Second World War between 1939 and 1945.

He is considered a member of the \"second generation\" of American free improvisers. He is married to Canadian artist Brandy Gale. He is the son of Henry J. Kaiser Jr. and the grandson of industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. ==Biography== In 1977, Kaiser founded Metalanguage Records with Larry Ochs (Rova Saxophone Quartet) and Greg Goodman. In 1979 he recorded With Friends Like These with Fred Frith, a collaboration which continued over the next 20 years. In 1983 they recorded Who Needs Enemies, and in 1987 the compilation album With Enemies Like These, Who Needs Friends? They joined with fellow experimental musicians John French, and English folk-rocker Richard Thompson to form French Frith Kaiser Thompson for two eclectic albums, Live, Love, Larf & Loaf (1987)\n",

After spending 1946 in operations ranging from New Brunswick down to the Florida Keys, she embarked her first group of midshipmen for a cruise to Latin America during the summer of 1947.

Midshipman cruises and NATO maneuvers added new vistas and dimensions to her training exercises as did several rescue operations. Twice in 1952 this destroyer received commendations for her efforts after ships had collided at sea, while in 1957 and again in 1961 aviators from the carriers and respectively were plucked from the sea. Meanwhile, to update and increase her value to the Navy, O'Hare was converted during 1953 to a radar picket ship (DDR-889) and in 1958 received installation of the electronic data system. The next major modification, in 1963, a FRAM Mk I overhaul, restored her original designation. ===1963-1973=== The increasing tempo and scope of the Vietnam War brought O'Hare an assignment to WestPac duty.

      "Trans fat regulation, that aims to limit the amount of \"trans fat\" — fat containing trans fatty acids — in industrial food products, has been enacted in many countries. These regulations were motivated by numerous studies that pointed to significant negative health effects of trans fat. It is generally accepted that trans fat in the diet is a contributing factor in several diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. ==History== As early as 1956, there were suggestions in the scientific literature that trans fats could be a cause of the large increase in coronary artery disease but after three decades the concerns were still largely unaddressed. Instead, by the 1980s, fats of animal origin had become one of the greatest concerns of dieticians. Activists, such as Phil Sokolof, who took out full page ads in major newspapers, attacked the use of beef tallow in McDonald's french fries and urged fast-food companies to switch to vegetable oils. The result was an almost overnight switch by most fast-food outlets to trans fats. Studies in the early 1990s, however\n",

      ", brought renewed scrutiny and confirmation of the negative health impact of trans fats. In 1994, it was estimated that trans fats caused 20,000 deaths annually in the United States from heart disease. Mandatory food labeling for trans fats was introduced in several countries. Campaigns were launched by activists to bring attention to the issue and change the practices of food manufacturers. ==International regulation== The international trade in food is standardized in the Codex Alimentarius. Hydrogenated oils and fats come under the scope of Codex Stan 19. Non-dairy fat spreads are covered by Codex Stan 256-2007.Codex Stan 256–2007 \"Standard for Fat Spreads and Blended Spreads\" (PDF file) In the Codex Alimentarius, trans fat to be labelled as such is defined as the geometrical isomers of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids having non-conjugated [interrupted by at least one methylene group (−CH2−)] carbon-carbon double bonds in t\n",

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set a limit for trans fats of 0.5 grams per serving in 2015. In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a tolerance level of 2 g/100g of fat in fats and oils. In Canada, Health Canada has set a maximum limit of 5% of the total fat content of a food product to be trans fat. In Australia and New Zealand, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) sets a limit of no more than 2% of the fat content of foods to be trans fats. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a standard of 1% or less of trans fats in food products. In South Africa, the Food Standards, Labelling and Consumer Protection Act No. 25 of 2020 sets a maximum of 1.5% of trans fat in any food product. In India, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) sets a standard of not more than 3% of trans-fatty acids in any food. In China, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) has set a national standard of 2% or less trans fat in food. ==Food industry response== The food industry has responded to the regulations by reducing the amount of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils in their products. In 1999, McDonald's announced that it would eliminate trans fats from its french fries and baked potatoes. In the early 21st century, many fast-food chains, including Burger King, Wendy's, Arby's, and Dairy Queen, began to phase out trans fat from their frying oils. Many food manufacturers, including Procter & Gamble, Nabisco, and Frito-Lay, began to reformulate their products to reduce or eliminate trans fat content. In response to the FDA's ruling, many companies, including ConAgra Foods, General Mills, Kellogg Company, and PepsiCo, announced that they would phase out trans fats entirely from their products. ==Conclusion== Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fatty acid that are created during the hydrogenation process.

Located near the northern tip of the Leelanau Peninsula, Northport is located within Leelanau Township, and lies on the shore of Grand Traverse Bay, a bay of Lake Michigan. Northport had a population of 496 at the 2020 census. The village is located about north of Traverse City, and is part of that city's micropolitan area. From 1863 to 1883, Northport served as the county seat of Leelanau County. ==History== In 1848 Michigan suffered from a smallpox epidemic that affected the entire community of people. Chief Peter Waukazoo and Reverend George Smith moved the community as well as the Holland-area Ottawa Mission up to the Leelanau Peninsula on boats or canoes. When the settlers had reached their destination they called it Waukazooville. Deacon Joseph Dame arrived at Waukazooville in 1854 and decided to change the name to Northport at this time.

There was no doctor in town at this time so Reverend Smith was called on to deliver babies and help the ill. Many people that ended up living in Northport came from New York or Canada. The fishermen, farmers, and other community members would gather on the bay and cut chunks of ice for fisheries, hotels, or even private homes. The cherry industry that is prevalent in Northport today had just begun in 1853 on Reverend Smith's farm. Farmers began producing cherries so much within those first few years that cherries were being shipped to nearby cities for their markets. The cherry industry in Northport and Leelanau County remains one of the largest in the world. ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. === Major highways === * reaches the northernmost point along its route in Northport, with the highway's two legs mee\n",

A \"swashbuckler\" protagonist is heroic, daring, and idealistic: he rescues damsels in distress, protects the downtrodden, and uses duels to defend his honor or that of a lady or to avenge a comrade. Swashbucklers often engage in daring and romantic adventures with bravado or flamboyance. Swashbuckler heroes are gentleman adventurers who dress elegantly and flamboyantly in coats, waistcoats, tight breeches, large feathered hats, and high leather boots, and they are armed with the thin rapiers used by aristocrats. Swashbucklers are not unrepentant brigands or pirates, although some may rise from such disreputable stations and achieve redemption. His opponent is typically characterized as a dastardly villain.

There is a long list of swashbucklers who combine courage, skill, resourcefulness, and a distinctive sense of honor and justice, as for example Cyrano de Bergerac, The Three Musketeers, The Scarlet Pimpernel, Robin Hood, and Zorro. As a historical fiction genre, it is often set in the Renaissance or Cavalier era. The stock character also became common in the film genre, which extended the genre to the Golden Age of Piracy. As swashbuckler stories are often mixed with the romance genre, there will often be a beautiful, aristocratic female love interest to whom the hero expresses a refined, courtly love. At the same time, since swashbuckler plots are often based on intrigues involving corrupt religious figures or scheming monarchs, the heroes may be tempted by alluring femme fatales or vampish courtesans. ==Etymology== \"Swashbuckler\" is a compound of \"swash\" (archaic: to swagger with a drawn sword) and \"buckler\" (a small shield gripped in the fist)\n",

All hardware innovations necessitated either overloading the use of data in an existing protocol or the creation of custom device drivers and the evangelization of a new protocol to developers.

      "Kubb (pronounced in Swedish and Gutnish) is a lawn game where the objective is to knock over wooden blocks () by throwing wooden batons () at them. Kubb can be described as a combination of bowling and horseshoes. Play takes place on a small rectangular playing field, known as a \"pitch\". \"Kubbs\" are placed at both ends of the pitch, and the \"king\", a larger wooden block, is placed in the middle of the pitch. Some rules vary from country to country and from region to region, but the ultimate objective of the game is to knock over the \"kubbs\" on the opposing side of the pitch, and then to knock over the \"king\", before the opponent does. Games can last from five minutes to well over an hour. The game can be played on a variety of surfaces such as grass, sand, concrete, snow, or even ice. == History == ===Possible forebears=== The features of kubb most distinguishing it from other pin-toppling games (such as bowling and skittles) are that 1) teams \"own\" opposite sides of the playing field, and 2) toppled pins are \"re\n",

Though differing from kubb in detail, , as published in Leipzig in 1800, displays most of the fundamental features of kubb, including team sides, recycled pins, a kingpin, and even the requirement to throw from behind one's own pins; though as in the Polish game, the main projectile is a ball rather than a baton. The Karelian game kyykkä and the possibly Siberian game bunnock both feature team sides and (unlike the Polish game and kaisers) use versions of batons as projectiles rather than balls. Though typologically related to kubb, no definite historical connection between these games and kubb has been shown. ===Sweden=== Sören Wallin has identified the Swedish game (as described in a 1911 encyclopedia) as essentially the same as, and the forebear of, kubb.

Aberdare is south-west of Merthyr Tydfil, north-west of Cardiff and east-north-east of Swansea. During the 19th century it became a thriving industrial settlement, which was also notable for the vitality of its cultural life and as an important publishing centre. ==Etymology== The name Aberdare means \"mouth/confluence of the river Dare\", as the town is located where the Dare river () meets the Cynon (). While the town's Welsh spelling uses formal conventions, the English spelling of the name reflects the town's pronunciation in the local Gwenhwyseg dialect of South East Wales. Dâr is an archaic Welsh word for oaks (derwen is the singulative), and the valley was noted for its large and fine oaks as late as the 19th century.

This may have led to the mountain itself being named Bryn-y-Beddau (hill of graves) although other local traditions associate the name with the Battle of Hirwaun Wrgant. ===Middle Ages=== Aberdare lies within the commote (cwmwd) of Meisgyn, in the cantref of Penychen. The area is traditionally given as the scene of the battle of Hirwaun Wrgant, where the allied forces of the Norman Robert Fitzhamon and Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last Welsh prince of Glamorgan, defeated Rhys ap Tewdwr, prince of Dyfed.

The town was a major source of coal, iron and copper, and was home to several large collieries, including the Aberdare Colliery, which was one of the deepest in the world at the time of its closure in 1968. The town also had a number of ironworks and copperworks, including the famous Aberdare Copperworks, which was established in 1768 and closed in the early 20th century. The town's population grew rapidly during this period, from just over 1,000 people in the mid-nineteenth century to over 30,00 by the mid-twentieth century. ===Cultural history=== The town has a rich cultural heritage, with a number of notable writers, artists and musicians hailing from the area. One of the most famous of these is the poet Dylan Thomas, who was born in Swansea but spent much of his childhood in Aberdare, where his father worked as a colliery manager. Thomas's childhood home, Ty Isaf, is now a museum dedicated to his life and work.

      "Hugo Philipp Jacob Wolf (13 March 1860 – 22 February 1903) was an Austrian composer of Slovene origin, particularly noted for his art songs, or Lieder. He brought to this form a concentrated expressive intensity which was unique in late Romantic music, somewhat related to that of the Second Viennese School in concision but diverging greatly in technique. Though he had several bursts of extraordinary productivity, particularly in 1888 and 1889, depression frequently interrupted his creative periods, and his last composition was written in 1898, before he suffered a mental collapse caused by syphilis. == Early life (1860–1887) == Hugo Wolf was born in Windischgrätz in the Duchy of Styria (now Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia), then a part of the Austrian Empire. Herbert von Karajan was related to him on his maternal side. He spent most of his life in Vienna, becoming a representative of a \"New German\" trend in Lieder, a trend which followed from the express\n",

A child prodigy, Wolf was taught piano and violin by his father beginning at the age of four, and once in primary school studied piano and music theory with Sebastian Weixler. Subjects other than music failed to hold his interest; he was dismissed from the first secondary school he attended as being \"wholly inadequate\", left another over his difficulties in the compulsory Latin studies, and after a falling-out with a professor who commented on his \"damned music\", quit the last. From there, he went to the Vienna Conservatory, much to the disappointment of his father, who had hoped his son would not try to make his living from music. Once again, however, he was dismissed for \"breach of discipline\", although the oft- rebellious Wolf would claim he quit in frustration over the school's conservatism. After eight months with his family, he returned to Vienna to teach music. Though his fiery temperament was not ideally suited to teaching, Wolf's musical gifts, as well as his personal charm, earned him attention \n",

Wolf's next work, a string quartet, was premiered by the Hellmesberger Quartet, and his first published song cycle, \"Fünf Lieder\", was published in the same year. In the summer of 1879, Wolf met the composer Alexander von Zemlinsky, who became his closest friend and confidant. Zemlinksy introduced Wolf to the works of Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt, which had a profound effect on Wolf's development as a composer. == Career (1888–1903) == Wolf's breakthrough as a composer came in 1868, when his song \"Mondnacht\" (Moon Night) was performed at the Vienna Sing-Akademie. This was followed by a burst of creativity, during which he composed more than 100 songs, including the song cycle \"Spanisches Liederbuch\" (Spanish Songbook) and the song \"Der Corregidor\" (The Corregidor), which became one of his best-known works. In the early 1890s, Wolf began to focus more on larger forms, such as the opera and the symphony.

      "The Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge is a 5,484 acre (22 km2) wildlife refuge in Crittenden County, Arkansas, managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1961 from land acquired from the former \"Wapanocca Outing Club\" which was a prestigious hunting club formed in 1886. The refuge is located 3 miles (5 km) west of the Mississippi River near the city of Turrell, Arkansas. The refuge was once a bend in the Mississippi River. It is a migration stopover for warblers and other neo-tropical birds. The refuge is host to the blue heron, and the common egret as well as the bald eagle. The refuge is a major stopover on the Mississippi Flyway\n",
